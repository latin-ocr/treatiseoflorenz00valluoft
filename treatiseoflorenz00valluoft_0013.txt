T HE Donation of Constantine—the most famous forgery
in European history; papal authority—since the triumph

of Christianity the most perennial question of European
society; historical criticism—-one of the most comprehensive, most
alluring, and most baffiing enterprises of the modern mind;
Lorenzo Valla—the greatest of the professional Italian human-
ists; these lines of study have converged, accidentally perhapS, to
ι call forth the following pages. Much of the subject matter which
might properly form their introduction I have already treated
more fully in an earlier work,1 and a brief statement will suffice
here.

The Donation of Constantine (Constitutum Constantini),
written probably not long after the middle of the eighth century,
became widely known through its incorporation in the Pseudo-
Isidorian Decretals (about 847-8 53). Parts of it were included in
most of the medieval collections of canon law; Anselm's‚ Deus-
deuius, and Gratian's great work (the Decretum, or Concordia
discordantium canonum). It purports to reproduce a legal docu-
ment in which the Emperor 'Constantine the Great, reciting his
baptism and the cure of his leprosy at the hands of Sylvester,
Bishop of Rome 314-336, confirmed the privilege of that pontifi?
