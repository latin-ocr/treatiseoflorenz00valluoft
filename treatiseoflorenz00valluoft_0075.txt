THE DONATION OF CONSTANTINE 63

that Sylvester refused the gift than that Constantine wished to
give it, and a benefaction is not conferred upon a man against his
will. Indeed, we must suspect not so much that Sylvester refused
the grants as that he tacitly disclosed that neither could Con-
stantine legally make them nor could he himself IQY accept.

[ὅ avarice, ever blind and ill-advised! Let us suppose that you
may be able to adduce even genuine documents for the assent of
Sylvester, not tampered with, authenti& even SO, were the grants
actually made which are found in such documents? Where is any
taking possession, any delivery? For if Constantine gave a charter
only, he did not want to befriend Sylvester, but to mock him.
It is likely, you say, that any one who makes a grant, gives pos-
session of it, also See what you are saying; for it is certain that
possession was not given, and the question is whether the title was
given! It is likely that one who did not give possession did not
want to give the title either.

Or is it not certain that possession was never given? To deny
it is the sheerest impudence. Did Constantine ever lead Sylvester
in state to the Capitol amid the shouts of the assembled QuiriteS,
heathen as they were? Did he place him on a golden throne in
the presence of the whole Senate? Did he command the magis· ’
trateS, each in the order of his rank, to salute their king and
prostrate themselves before him? This, rather than the giving of
some palace such as the Lateran, is customary in the creation of
new rulerS. Did he afterwards escort him through all Italy? Did
he go with him to the Gauls? Did he go to the Spains? Did he
go to the Germans, and the rest of the West? Or if they both
thought it too onerous to traverse so many landS, to whom did
they delegate such an important function, to represent Caesar in
transferring possession and Sylvester in receiving it? Distin-
guished men, and men of eminent authority, they must have
been: and nevertheless we do not know who they were. And how
much weight there is here in these two words, give and receive!
To pass by ancient instanceS, Ι do not remember to have seen
any other procedure when any one was made lord of a city, a
country, or a province; for we do not count possession as given
