² THE DoNATION OF CONSTANTINE 131

“Wherefore‚ before the living God, who commanded us to reign,
and in the face of his terrible judgment, we entreat all the em-

perors our successorS, and all the nobles, the satraps also and the ’

most glorious Senate, and all the people in the whole world, like—
wise also for the future, that no one of them, in any way, be
allowed either to break this, or in any way overthrow it.''

What a fair, what a devout adjurationi It is just as if a wolf
should entreat by his innocence and good saith the other wolves
and the shepherds not to try to take away from him, or demand
back, the sheep which he has taken and divided among his off-
spring and his friends. Why are you so afraid, Constantine? If
your work is not of God it will be destroyed; but if it is of God
it cannot be destroyed. But I see! You wished to imitate the
Apocalypse, where it says: “For I testify unto every man that
heareth all the words of the prophecy of this book, If any man
shall add unto these things, God shall add unto him the plagues
that are written in this book: And if any man shall take away
from the words of the book of this prophecy, God shall take away
his part out of the book of life, and out of the holy city.''1 But
you had never read the Apocalypse; therefore these are not
your words.

“If any one, moreover—which we do not believe—prove a
scorner in this matter, he shall be condemned and shall be subject
to eternal damnation 3 and shall feel the holy apostles of God,
Peter and Paul, opposed to him in the present and in the future
life. And he shall be burned in the lower hell and shall perish with
the devil and all the impious.'' β

This terrible threat is the usual one, not of a secular ruler‚ but
of the early priests and flamenS, and nowadayS, oi ecclesiastics.
And so this is not the utterance of Constantine, but of some iool
of a priest who, stuffed and pudgy, knew neither what to say nor
how to say it, and, gorged with eating and heated with wine,
belched out these wordy sentences which convey nothing to

1 Rev. xxii, 18-19.
