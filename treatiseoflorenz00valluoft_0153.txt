THE DONATION OF CONSTANTINE 141

why wonder that they believed these stories where so much profit
allured theni, seeing that they are led to believe a great many
things, in which no profit is apparent, through their extraordinary
ignorance? Do you not, at Ara Coeli, in that most notable temple
and in the most impressive place see the fable of the Sibyl and
Octavian1 depicted by the authority, they say, of Innocent ΙΙΙ,
who wrote it and who also left an account of the destruction of the
Temple of Peace on the day of the Savior⁷s birth, that is, at the
delivery of the Virgin?2 These stories tend rather to the destruc-
tion of faith, by their falsity, than ιο the establishment of faith,
by their wonders. Does the vicar of T ruth dare to tell a lie under

s the guise of piety, and consciously entangle himself in this sin.³

Or does he not lie? Verily, does he not see „that 1n perpetratmg

this he contradicts the most holy men? Omitting others; Jerome
che ιε5ιίᾗῖὃ11ΥἝῖ Varro that there were ten Sibyls, and Varro
wrote his work before the time of AugustuS. Jerome also writes
thus of the Temple of Peace: “Vespasian and Titus, after the
Temple of Peace was built at Rome, dedicated the vessels of the
temple [of the Jews] and all manner of gifts 1n her shrine, as the
Greek and Roman historians tell.'' And this ignorant man, alone,
wants us to believe his libel, barbarously written at that, rather
than the most accurate histories of ancient and most painstaking
authors!

Since Ι have touched on Jerome, Ι will not suffer the following
insult to him to be passed by in silence. At Rome, by the authority
of the Pope, with the candles ever burning, as though for a relic

of the saintS‚ is shown a copy of the Bible, which they say is

'‘Q-written in the hand of Jerome. Do you seek proof ³ Why, there 15

“much embroidered eloth and gold,’' as Vlrgil sayS, a thing which
indicates rather that it was not written by the hand of Jerome.
When I inspected it more carefully, Ι found that it was written

1This apocryphal story ran that the Sibyl prophesied of Christ, and that
Augustus erected an altar to him.

² The Temple of Peace was built by Vespasian and was not destroyed until it
was burned down in the time of Commodus.
