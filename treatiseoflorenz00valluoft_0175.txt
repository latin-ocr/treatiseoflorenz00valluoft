THE DONATION OF CONSTANTINE 163

of Constantine in execution, he decrees that the kingdom itself
belonged to and was subject to the Roman church. This decretal
his successors, Benedict and Clement, revoked outright, as wicked

and unjust.

But what 1s the significance of “your anxiety, Roman pontifis, &ss
in ffiififi'g‘each Emperor to confirm the Donatlon of Constan-
timii? ss fbf! that you distrust its legality? But you are wash-

. iffiks [you labor in vain], as they say3 for that Donation
-never existed, and since it does not exist it cannot be confirmed3
and whatever the Caesars grant, their acts are due to deception
as to the precedent of Constantine3 and they cannot grant the
Empire.

 

However, let us grant that Constantine made the Donation and
that Sylvester was at one time in possession, but afterwards either
he himself or another of the Popes lost possession. (I am speaking
now of that of which the Pope ismot in possession3 later on I
will speak of that of which he is in possession.) What more can
Ι grant you than to concede the existence of that which never was y

. and never could be? But even 50, Ι 53Υ that you cannot effect ἵ
3 recovery either by divine or by human law. In the ancient law ἶ
it was forbidden that a Hebrew be a Hebrew’ 5 slave more thanvts
six yearS, and every fiftieth year also everything reverted to the
original owner. Shall a Christian, in the dispensation of grace,
be oppressed in eterna] 513νέιΥ by the vicar of the Christ who
redeemed us from our servitude? What do I say! Shall he be
recalled to servitude after he has been set free and has long
enjoyed his freedom?

How brutal, how violent, how barbarous the tLranny of priests s

’ often is, Ι (10 ιιοῐ 53Υ. If this was not known before, it has lately
been learned from that monster of depravity, John Vitelleschi,
cardinal and patriarch, who wore out the sword of Peter, with
which [the apostle] cut off the ear of Malchus, with the blood of
Christians. By this sword he himself also perished.1 But is it true

1 The assassination of Vitelleschi, supposedly by order of the Pope, took place
in March, 1440, and is one of the means of dating Valla’s treatise.
