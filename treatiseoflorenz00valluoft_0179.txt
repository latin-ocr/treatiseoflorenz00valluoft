own kind, but over an inferior. How much more ought we to act
thuS, and as men have due regard for men, since in the words of
Marcus Fabius there is no beast upon the earth so fierce that his
own likeness is not sacred to him?

Now there are four reasons why wars are waged: either for
avenging a wrong and defending friends; or for sear of incurring
disaster later, if the strength of others is allowed to increase; or
for hope of booty3 or for desire of glory. Of these the first is
rather honorable, the second less so, and the last two are far from
honorable. And wars were indeed often waged against the Ro-
mans, but after they had defended themselveS, they waged war
against their assailants and against otherS. Nor is there any
nation which yielded to their sway unless conquered in war and
subdued3 whether justly, or for what cause, they themselves could
judge. Ι should be unwilling to condemn them as fighting unjustly
or to aequit them as fighting in a just cause. Ι can only say that
the Roman people waged wars against others for the same reason
as other peoples and kings did, and that it was left open even to
those who were attacked and conquered in war to revolt from the
Romans just as they revolted from other masters; lest perchance
(and none would agree to this) all authority should be imputed
to the oldest people who were first masters; that is, to those who
were the first to take possession of what belonged to others.

And yet the Roman people had a better right over nations
conque-{edin ‘war‘than had the Caesars in their overthrow of the
Republic. Wherefore, if it ”was right for the nations to revolt
from Constantine, and, what is far more, from the Roman people,
