THE DONATION OF CONSTANTINE 2 5

words Ι have just used, reprove Peter to his face in the presence
01 the church because he needed reproof? And he left this written
for our instruction. But perhaps I am not a Paul that Ι should
reprove a Peter. Yea, I am a Paul because I imitate Paul. Just aS,

and ffii's 15 far greatesssbecome one in spirit with God when I ι

diligently observe his commandmentS. Nor is any one made lm-
mune from chiding by an eminence which did not make Peter
immune, and many others possessed 01 the same rank3 for in-
stance, MarcelluS,1 who offered a libation to the godS, and Celes-
tine [1] who entertained the Nestorian heresy‚ and certain even
within our own memory whom we know were reproved, to say
nothing 01 those condemned, by their inferiors, for who is not
inferior to the Pope?²
It is not my aim to inveigh against any one and write so-called
Philippics against him—be that villainy far from me—but to root
out error from men's minds, to free them from vices and crimes
by either admonition or reproof. I would not dare to say [that my
aim is] that 0111οι5, taught by me, should prune with steel the
papal see, which is Christ's vineyard, rank with overabundant
shootS, and compel it to bear rich grapes instead 01 meager
wildingS. When Ι (10 that, is there any one who will want to close
either· my mouth or his own ears, much less propose punishment
and death? Ι1 one should do so, even if it were the Pope, what
should Ι call him, a good shepherd, or a deas viper which would
not choose to heed the voice 01 the charmer, but to strike his
limbs with its poisonous bite?
QX know that for a long time now men 's ears are waiting to hear
e 01101150 with which I charge the Roman pontifis. It 1s, indeed,
² an enormous one, due either to supine ignorance, or to gross
avarice which 1s the slave 01 ἰ(1015, οι 10 pride 01 empire of which
cruelty is ever the companion. For during some centuries now,

either they have not known that the Donation 01 Constantine 1s¹ ἵ
