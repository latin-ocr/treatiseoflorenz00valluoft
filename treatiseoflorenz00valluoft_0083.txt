ΤΗΕ ΒΟΝΑΤΙΟΝ OF CONSTANTINE 71

not in Greek, but 1n Latin letters, and of almost all the Emperors
in succession. There are many of them 1n my possession with this
inscription for the most part, under the lmage of the crOSS, “Co-n
cordia orbis [The Peace of the World]' . 'What an infinite number
of coins of the supreme pontifis would be found if you ever had
ruled Rome! But none such are found, neither gold nor silver,
nor are any mentioned as having been seen by any one. And yet
whoever held the government at Rome at that time had to have*
his own coinage: doubtless the Pope's would have borne the

image of the Savior or of Peter.

But it is high time, if I am not to be too proliX, to give the
adversaries' cause, already struck down and mangled‚ the mortal
blow and to cut its throat with a single stroke. Almost every
history worthy of the name speaks of Constantine as a Christian
from boyhood, with his father Constantius, long before the pon-
tificate of Sylvester3 as, for instance, EusebiuS, author of the
Church History, which Rufinus, himself a great scholar, trans-
lated into Latin, adding two books on his own times,1 Both of these

passages, while not definitely saying that Constantine was a Christian from boy-
