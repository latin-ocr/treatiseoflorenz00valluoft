THE DONATION OF CONSTANTINE 171

figuratively speaking, the city being given up for lost, they betake
themselves to their citadel,—which forthwith they are constrained
by lack of provisions to surrender. “The Roman church,'' they
say, “is entitled by prescription to what it possesses.'' Why then ’ἰ
does it lay claim to that, the greater part, to which it has no title “
by prescription‚ and to which others are entitled by prescription;
unless others cannot act toward it as it can act toward them?

The Roman church has title by prescription! Why then does
it so often take care to have the Emperors confirm its right? Why
does it vaunt the Donation, and its confirmation by the Caesars?
If this alone is sufficient, you seriously weaken it by not at the
same time keeping silent about the other title [by prescription].
Why don't you keep silent about that other? Obviously because
this is not sufficient.

The Roman church has prescribed! And how can it have
entered a prescription where no title is established but only l,
possession through bad saith? Or if you deny that the possession j
was a case of bad faith, at least you cannot deny that the saith ⁵
[in the Donation] was stupid. Or, in a matter of such importance
and notoriety, ought ignorance of fact and of law to be excused?

Of fact, because‘Uofis‘t‘antine did not make a grant of Rome and .. -

the provinces; a fact of which a man of the common people might
well be ignorant, biit* not 'the supreme pontifi . Of law, because they
could not be granted; which any Christian ought to know. And 50,
will stupid credulity give you a right to that which, had you been
more conscientiOUS‚ wouldneverfflhave been yours ?,Welll Now, at
least, after I have shown that you held possession through igno-
rance and stupidity, do you not lose that right, if it was such?
and what ignorance unhappily brought you, does not knowledge
happily take away again? and does not the property revert from
the illegal to the legal master, perchance even with interest? But
if you continue to keep possession in the future, your ignorance
is henceforth changed into malice aforethought and into deceit,
and you become a fraudulent holder.
