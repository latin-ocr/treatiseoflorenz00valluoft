THE DONATION OF CONSTANTINE ‘ 79

even James of Voragine, though as an archbishop disposed to
favor the clergy, yet in his Acts of the Saintsl preserved silence
on the Donation of Constantine as fictitious and not fit to figure
'in the Acts of Sylvester; a conclusive judgment, in a way, against
those, if there were any, who would have committed it to writing.

But Ι want to take the forger himself tr “straw'' man ξ,

without wheat, by the neck, and drag him intqg'sss cour at do you
say, you forger? Whence comes it that we do not read this grant
in the Acts of Sylvester? This book, forsooth, is rare, difficult to
get, not owned by the many but rather kept as the Fasti once
were by the pontificeS, or the Sibylline books by the Decemvirs!
It was written in Greek, or Syriae, or Chaldee! Gelasius testi-

Day comes around.2 Yet nevertheless no one says that he has
read there what you put in it; no one has heard of it; no one has
dreamt of it. Or is there perhaps some other history of Sylvester?
And what can that be? I know no other, nor do I understand that
any other is referred to by you, for you speak of the one which
Gelasius says is read in many churches. In this, however, we do
not find your grant. But if it is not found in the Life of Sylvester,
why do you declare that it is? How did you dare to jest in a
matter of such importance, and to make sport of the cupidity of

[forger], instead of inveighing against the insanity of those who *fg

give him credence. If any one should say that this had been re-
corded for remembrance among the GreekS, the Hebrews, the
barbarians, would you not bid him name his author, produce his
book, and the passage, to be explained by a reliable translator,
before you would* believe it? But now your own language, and a
