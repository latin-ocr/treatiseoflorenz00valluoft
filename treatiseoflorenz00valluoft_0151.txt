on letterS, but not 011 other documentS, except among ignorant
people. For letters are said either to be given one (illi) or to be
given to one (ad illum); in the former case [they are given to]
one who carries them, a courier 101· instance, and puts them in

what Constantme would probably have said and done. And those
who think that 110 has told the truth, and defend him, whoever
they are, make themselves abetters and accessories in his stupidity
and madness. However, they have nothing now with which to
honorably excuse their opinion, not to speak 01 defending it.

quiesce in the truth when you see it disclosed, because certain great
men have thought otherwise? Great men, Ι 0311 1110111, 011 account
of their position, not on account 01 their wisdom or their good-
11055. How do you even know whether those whom you follow,
had they heard what you hear, would have continued in their
belief, or would have given it up? And moreover it is most con-

temptible to be willing to pay more regard to man than to Truth,

that is, to God. [I say this] 101· 501110 men beaten at every argu-
