time, who were “imperatores'' [generals]; for Cicero frequently
writes thus, ‘Marcus Cicero, imperator, to some other imperator,
greeting'' : though, later on, the Roman ruler, as the highest of
all, 15 0011οᾰ by way of distinctive title the Emperor.

“And at the same time the tiara and also the shoulder-band,—
that is the strap that usually surrounds our imperial neck.'' Who
ever heard “tiara'' [phrygium] used in Latin? Υο11 talk like a bar-
barian and want it to seem to me to be a speech of Constantine' 5

with a needle‘ ‘phrygiones'⁷ because the Phrygians invented them;
but what does‘ ‘phrygium'' mean? You do not explain this, which

band'' is a “strap,'' and you do not perceive what the strap is, for
you do not visualize a leather band, which we call a strap, en-
circling the Caesar's neck as an ornament. [It is of leather] , hence
we call harness and whips “straps'': but if ever gold straps are
mentioned, it can only be understood as applying to gilt harness
such as is put around the neck of a horse or of some other animal. .
But this has escaped your notice, I think. So when you wish to
put a strap around the Caesar's neck, or Sylvester’s, you change
a man, an Emperor, a supreme pontiff, into a horse or an ass,

“And also the purple mantle and scarlet tunic.⁷' Because Mat-
thew says “a scarlet robe‚'' and John “a purple robe,''l this fellow
tries to join them together in the same passage. But if they are
the same color, as the Evangelists imply, why are you not content,
as they were, to name either one alone; unleSS, like ignorant folk
today, you use “purple'' for silk goods of a whitish color? The
