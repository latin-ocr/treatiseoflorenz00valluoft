THE DONATION OF CONSTANTINE 149

Valerius Maximus tells that that chasm in the middle of the
forum, when Curtius, armed and spurring on his horse, plunged

’ l into it, closed again, and returned forthwith to its former state.¹

 

Again, the [effigy of] Juno Moneta, when it was asked, in jest,
by a certain Roman soldier at the capture of Veii, whether it
wanted to move to Rome, replied that it did.²

Titus LiviuS, an earlier and more authoritative writer, knows
neither of these stories. For he has it that the chasm was per-
manent, not a sudden opening but an old one, there before the
founding of the city, and called Curtius' Pond, because Mettius

ι CurtiUS, a Sabine, fleeing from an attack by the RomanS, had

hidden in it ; and that the Juno did not reply, but nodded assent,
and it was added to the story afterwards that she had spoken.3
And about the nod aISO, it is evident that they lied, either by inter-
preting the movement of the image when they pulled it away as
made by its own accord, or by pretending in the same J’oking way
in which they asked the question that the hostile, conquered, stone
goddess nodded assent. Indeed, Livy does not say that she nodded,
but that the soldiers exclaimed that she nodded. Such storieS, too,
good writers do not defend as facts, but excuse as tradition.
For even as this same Livy sayS, “This indulgence is to be
granted antiquity, that by mingling the human and the divine it
may make the beginnings of cities more august.''4 And elsewhere:
“But in connection with events of such ancient timeS, if proba-
bilities should be accepted as facts, no harm would be done. These
stories are more suited to the display of a stage which delights in
wonders, than to sober belief ; it is not worth while either to affirm
or to refute them.''⁵

Terentius Varr0, an earlier, more learned and, I think, more
authoritative writer than these two, says there were three accounts
of Curtius' 'Pond given by as many writers; one by Proculus, that
