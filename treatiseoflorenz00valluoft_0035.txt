 

THE DONATION OF CONSTANTINE 23

the same course toward him who goes far beyond proscription,
who would pursue me with the invisible darts of his authority, so
that I could rightly say, “Whither shall I go from thy spirit, or
whither shall I fiee from thy presence?''1 Unless perhaps we think
the supreme pontifi would bear these attacks more patiently than
would otherS. Far from it; for Ananias, the high priest, in the
presence of the tribune who sat as judge, ordered Paul when he
said he lived in good conscience to be smitten on the mouth; and
Pashur, holding the same rank, threw Jeremiah into prison for
the boldness of his speech. The tribune and the governor, indeed,
were able and willing to protect the former, and the king the
latter, from priestly violence. But what tribune, what governor,
what king, even if he wanted to, could snatch me from the hands
of the chief priest if he should seize me?

But there is no reason why this awful, twofold peril should
trouble me and turn me from my purpose, for the supreme pontiff
may not bind nor loose any one contrary to law and justice. And
to give one's life in defense of truth and justice is the path of the
highest virtue, the highest honor, the highest reward. Have not
many undergone the hazard of death for the defense of their
terrestrial fatherland? In the attainment of the celestial father-
land (they attain it who please God, not men), shall I be deterred
by the hazard of death? Away then with trepidation, let fears

far remove, let doubts pass away. With a brave soul, with utter κ
fidelity, with good hope, the cause of truth must be defended, the 1

cause of justice, the cause of God.
Nor is he to be esteemed a true orator who knows how to speak

well, unless he also has the courage to speak. So let us have the .

courage to accuse him, whoever he IS, that commits crimes calling
for accusation. And let him who sins against all be called to
accountby the voice of one speaking for all. Yet perhaps I ought
not to reprove my brother in public, but by himself. Rather,
κ “Them that sin' 'and do not accept private admonition‘ ‘rebuke
before all, that others also may fear.’'2 Or did not Paul, whose
