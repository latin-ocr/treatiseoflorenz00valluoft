Μ DONATION OF CONSTANTINE 49

“Most worthy prince and son, Caesar, though Ι cannot but ᾗ* ›

like and embrace your piety‚ so abject and effusive, nevertheless

, you have fallen somewhat into error in offering gifts to God and

immolating victims, and Ι am not at all surprised at it, for you are
still a novice in the Christian service. As once it was not right
for the priest to sacrifice every sort of beast and animal and fowl,
so now he is not to accept every sort of gift. I am a priest and
pontiff, and I ought to look carefully at what I permit to be

obscured by his receiving gifts? Doubtless because he might seem
to sell sacred thingS, to put the gift of God out at usury, to want
the patronage of men, to lower and lessen the worth of his bene-
faction. He preferred, therefore, to make princes and kings his
beneficiaries rather than to be himself their beneficiary, or even
to allow mutual benefactionS. For, as says the Lord, ‘It is more
