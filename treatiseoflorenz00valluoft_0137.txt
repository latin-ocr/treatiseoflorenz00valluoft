THE DONATION OF CONSTANTINE 125

they are to be controlled by him and by his successors, and that
they remain under the law of the holy Roman church.''

We have already, in the oration of the Romans and that of
Sylvester, said a good deal about this.1 Here it is in place to say
that no one would have thought of including all the nations in a
single word of a grant3 and that a man who had earlier followed
out the minutest details of strapS, the shoeS, the linen horse-

’ clothS, would not have thought of omitting to cite by name

provinces which now have separate kings or rulers equal to kingS, ‚
and more than one to each. But this forger, of course, did not . ι
know Qrovinces were under Constantine, and which were ,
