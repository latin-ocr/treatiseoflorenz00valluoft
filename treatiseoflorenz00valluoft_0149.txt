THE DONATION OF CONSTANTINE 137

ancient writer ought to be adduced, one not later than the time
of Constantine. However‚ none su'ch is adduced, but as it happens
some recent writer or other. Whence did he get it? For whoever
composes a narrative about an earlier age, either writes at the
dictation of the Holy Spirit, or follows the authority of former
writerS, and of those, of course, who wrote concerning their own

age. So whoever does not follow earlier writers will be one of' ' -.
’ those to whom the remoteness of the event affords the boldness ψ ,

to lie. But if this story is to be read anywhere, it is not consistent
with antiquity any more than that stupid narrative of the glossa-
tor Accursius about Roman ambassadors being sent to Greece to
get laws agrees with Titus Livius and the other best writers.

“Given at Rome, on the third day before the Kalends of April,
Constantine Augustus consul for the fourth time, and Gallicanus
consul for the fourth time.''1

He took the next to the last day of March so that we might
feel that this was done in the season of holy dayS, which, for the
most part, come at that time. And “Constantine consul for the
fourth time, and Gallicanus consul for the fourth time.'' Strange
if each had been consul thrice, and they were colleagues in a
fourth consulship! But stranger still that the Augustus, a leper,
with elephantiasis (which disease is as remarkable among diseaseS,
as elephants areamong animals), should want to even accept a
consulship, when king Azariah‚ as soon as he was affected with
leprosy, kept himself secluded, while the management of the king-
dom was given over to Jotham his son; ²and almost all lepers
have acted similarly. And by this argument alone the wholea
, “privilege'' is confuted outright, destroyed, and overturned. And¹
ἶξῗὲᾗὶῖ one d1sputes the fact that Constantine must have been
leprous before he was consul, he should know that according to
physicians this disease develops gradually, that according to the

n the best text of the Donation this is not called the fourth consulship of
llicanus. In any case, however, the date is impossible; no such consulship. as
this is known.
