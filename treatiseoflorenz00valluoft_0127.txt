THE DONATION OF CONSTANTINE 1 15

attire they were to wear? If there are games of any kind played
among the demons which inhabit the air Ι should think that they
would consist in copying the apparel, the pride and the luxury
of the clergy, and that the demons would be delighted most by
this kind of masquerading.

Which shall I censure the more, the stupidity of the ideaS, or‘
of the words? You have heard about the ideas; here are illustra-
tions of his words. He says, “It seems proper for our Senate ῖοξ
be adorned’' (as though it were not assuredly adorned), and to be ²
adorned forsooth with “glory.'' And what is being done he wishes
»understood as already done; as, “we have proclaimed⁷' for “we
proclaim⁷': for the speech sounds better that way. And he puts
the same act in the present and in the past tense; aS, “we decree‚’'
and “we have decreed.'' And everything is stuffed with these
words, “we decree,'' “we decorate,'' “imperial,'' “imperial rank,''
“power,'' “glory.'' He uses “extat'' for “est,’' though “extare''
means to stand out or to be above; and “nempe'' for “scilicet''
[that is, “indeed'' for “to wit'']; and “concubitores'' [translated
above, bed-watchers] for “contubernales'' [companions or at-
tendants]. “Concubitores'’ are literally those who sleep together
and have intercourse ; they must certainly be understood to be
harlots. He adds those with whom he may sleep, Ι suppose, that
he may not fear nocturnal phantomS.1 He adds “chamberlains'';
he adds “door-keepers.’'

It is not an idle question to ask why he mentions these details.
He is setting up, not an old man, but a ward or a young son, and
like a doting father, himself arranges for him everything of which
his tender age has need, as David did for Solomonl And that the
story may be filled in in every respect, horses are given the

clergy,—lest they sit on asses' colts in that asinine way of ›

Christ's! And they are given horseS, not covered nor saddled
with coverings of white, but decorated with white color. And
what coverings! Not horse-clothS‚ either Babylonian or any other
kind, but “mappulae'' [translated above, saddle-cloths] and

“excubiorum’' [guardsJ.
