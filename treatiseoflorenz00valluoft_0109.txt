THE DoNATION OF CONSTANTINE ’ 97

wr rote the‘ ‘privilege'' linQafter the time of Constantine, and,

l ,

in his effort to embellish hisQLsehood forgot that earlier he had ⁴

sfflvents took place at Rome on the third day after
Constantine was baptized? So the trite old proverb applies nicely

ῑοᾟίῐη, ‘'Hars need good memorie5.'
And how 1s it that he speaks of a province of‘ ‘Byzantia,'' when

it was a town, Byzantium by name? The place was by no means ’

large enough for the erection of so great a city3 for the old city
of Byzantium was included within the walls of Constantinople.
And this man says the [new] city is to be built on the most fitting
place in it! Why does he choose to put Thrace, in which Byzan-
tium lies, in the East, when it lies to the north'? I suppose Con-
stantine did not know the place which he had chosen for the
building of the city, in what latitude it was, whether it was a
town or a province, nor how large it was!

“On the churches of the blessed apostles Peter and Paul, for
the providing of the lights, we have conferred landed estates of
possessionS, and have enriched them with different objects; and
through our sacred imperial mandate, we have granted them of
our property in the east as well as in the west; and even in the
north and in the southern quarter; namely‚ in Judea, Greece,
Asia, Thrace, Africa and Italy and the various islands; under
this condition indeed, that all shall be administered by the hand
of our most blessed father the supreme pontiff, Sylvester, and his
successorS.''

Ι

O you scoundrell Were there in Rome churches, that iS,2
templeS, dedicated to Peter and Paul? Who had constructed them? x

Who would have dared to build thern, when, as history tells uS,
the Christians had never had anything but secret and secluded
meeting—places? And if there had been any temples at Rome
dedicated to these apostleS, they would not have called for such
great lights as these to be set up in them3 they were little chapeIS,
not sanctuaries3 little shrines, not temples; oratories in private
houseS, not public places of worship So there was no need to care
for the temple lights, before the temples themselves were provided
