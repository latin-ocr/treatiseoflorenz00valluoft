THE DONATION OF CONSTANTINE 113

lence,'' you say, they are “made patricians and consuls.'' Who
has ever heard of senators or other men being madepatricians?
Consuls are “made,'' but not patricians. The senators, the con-
script fathers, are from patrician (also called senatorial), eques-
trian, or plebeian families as the case may be. It is greater, aISO,
to be a senator than to be a patriciam for a senator is one of
the chosen counsellors of the Republic, while a patrician is merely
one who derives his origin from a senatorial family. So one who
is a senator, or of the conscript fathers, is not necessarily forth-
with also a patrician. So my friends the Romans are now making
themselves ridiculous when they call their praetor “senator‚''
since a senate cannot consist of one man and a senator must have
colleagues, and he who is now called “senator’' performs the
function of praetor. But, you say, the title of patrician is found
in many books.l Yes; but in those which speak of times later
than Constantine; therefore the “privilege'' was executed after
Constantine.

But how can the clergy become consuls?2 The Latin clergy
have denied themselves matrimony; and will they become consuls,
make a levy of troopS, and betake themselves to the provinces
allotted them with legions and auxiliaries? Are servants and
slaves made consuls? And are there to be not tWO, as was cus-

the Roman church, are they to be honored with the rank of
general? And Ι was stupid enough to wonder at what was said
about the Pope's transformationl The attendants will be generals;
but the clergy soldierS. Will the clergy become soldiers or wear
military insignia, unless you share the imperial insignia with all
the clergy? [Ι may well ask,] for I do not know what you are
saying. And who does not see that this fabulous tale was con-
cocted by those who wished to have every possible license in the

1 The allusion is to the title of Patrician given to Pippin and to his sons as

defenders of the Roman See.
² The office of consul as it existed in the Republic and the Empire disappeared

in the time of the German invasions. The word was later applied quite differently,
to a group, practically a social class, at Rome.
