THE DONATION OF CONSTANTINE 179

singem If the source is bitter‚ so is the stream; if the root ἡ
is unclean 5ο are the branches; if the first fruit 1s unholy, so is

the lump.1 And vice versa, if the stream is bitter, the source must
be stopped up3 if the branches are unclean, the fault comes from
the roo · if the lump is unholy, the first fruit must also be ac-
cursed. an we justify the principle of papal power when we

perceive it to be the cause of such great crimes and of such great

and varied evils‘ss

Wherefore I declam, and cry aloud, nor, trusting God, will I
' sear men, that m my time no one in the supreme pontificate has

was recovered Christianity would be in an ideal state,—and not
rather the more oppressed by all kinds of crimes, extravagances
and lusts; if indeed it can be oppressed more, and if there is any
crime yet uncommitted!

And 5ο, that he may recover the other parts of the Donation‚

which all places are plagued‚ while Christ 1s dying of hunger and
nakedness in so many thousands of paupers. Nor does he know,
