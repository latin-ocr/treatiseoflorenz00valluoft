THE DONATION OF coNSTANTINE 77

· source of his narrative, and cites Pope Gelasius and many bishops

as witnesses3 it is, he sayS, “from the Acts of Sylvester (which
the blessed Pope Gelasius in the Council of the Seventy Bishops

‚ recounts as read by the catholiC, and in accordance with ancient

usage many churches he says follow this example) which reads:
‘Constantine . . ., etc.' ”¹ Considerably earlier, where books to
be read and books not to be read are treated, he had said also;
“The Acts of the blessed Sylvester, chief priest, though we know
not the name of him who wrote it, we know to be read by many of
the orthodox of the city of Rome, and in accordance with ancient
usage the churches follow this example.''2 Wonderful authority
this, wonderful evidence, irrefutable proof! I grant you this, that
Gelasius in speaking of the Council of the Seventy Bishops said
that. But did he say this, that the deed of gift is to be read
in the Acts of the most blessed Sylvester? He says, indeed, only
that the Acts of Sylvester are read, and that in Rome, and that
many other churches follow her authority. I do not deny this, I
concede it, I admit it, I also stand up with Gelasius as a witness
to it. But what advantage is this to you, except that you may
be shown to have deliberately lied in adducing your witnesses?
The name of the man who interpolated this [“Donation’' of
youi‘s] is not known, and he is the only one who says this [that
the Donation is in the Acts of Sylvester]; the name of the man
who wrote the history of Sylvester is not known, and he is the
only one cited as witneSS, and that erroneously. And good men ,
and prudent as you are,'you think this is enough and more than ³⁴
enough evidence for such an important transactionl Welll how
your judgment differs from mine! Even if this grant were con-
tained in the Acts of Sylvester, Ι should not think it was to be

> considered genuine, for that history is not history, but fanciful

 

and most shameful fiction, as I shall later show3 nor does any one
else of any authority whatever make mention of this grant. And
