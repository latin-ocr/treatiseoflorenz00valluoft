THE DONATION OF CONSTANTINE' ” 43

which you leave for yourself? With what military force, with
what resources can we go to meet them? Even now with the
troops of the whole empire we have scarcely enough power3 shall
we have enough then? Or will this part be forever at peace with
that? In my opinion it cannot be, for Rome will want to rule and
the other part will not want to be subject. Nay, even in your life-
time, shortly, when the old officials are removed and new ones
put in their placeS, when you withdraw to your kingdom and
fare far forth and another is ruling here, will not all interests be
different, that is, diverse and contrary? Usually when a kingdom
is divided between two brothers, at once the hearts of the people
also are divided, and war arises from within sooner than from
foreign enemies. That that will happen in this empire, who does
not see it? Or do you not know that it was chiefly on this ground
that the patricians once said that they would rather die before
the eyes of the Roman people than allow the motion to be carried
that part of the Senate and part of the plebeians should be sent
to live at Veii and that the Roman people should have two cities
in common; for if in one city there were so many dissensionS,
how would it be in two cities? So in our time, if there are so
many disorders in one empire, your own knowledge and your
labors are a witness, how will it be in two empiresl

“Come now, do you think that when you are engaged in warS,
there will be men here willing or able to bear you aid? Those
who will be in command of our soldiers and cities will always
shrink from arms and warfare, as will he who appoints them.
Indeed, will not either the Roman legions or the provinces them· ·-.,
selves try to despoil this man, so inexperienced in ruling and so ¹
inviting to violence, hoping that he will neither fight back nor .
seek revenge? By Hercules! I believe they will not remain in
allegiance a single month, but immediately, at the first news of χ
your departure they will rebel. What will you do Ρ What plan will
you follow when you are pressed with a twofold and even a mani-
fold war? The nations which we have conquered we can scarcely
hold; how can we withstand them if in addition we have war with
free peoples?
