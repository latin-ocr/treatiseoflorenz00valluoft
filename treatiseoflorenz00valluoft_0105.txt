THE DoNATION OF CONSTANTINE 93
to imitate the language of the sacred scriptures, which he had

, never read

“And we ordain and decree that he shall have the supremacy *¹

as well over the four seatS, Alexandria, Antioch, Jerusalem, and
Constantinople, as also over all the churches of God in the whole
earth. And the pontifi aISO, who at the time shall be at the head
of the holy Roman church itself, shall be more exalted than, and
chief over, all the priests of the whole world3 and, according to
his judgment everything which is to be provided for the service
of God, and for the saith or the stability of the Christians is to be
administered.''

I will not speak here of the barbarisms in [the forger's] lan-
guage when he says “chief over the priests'' instead of chief of the
priests; when he puts in the same sentence “extiterit'' and “ex-
istat'' [confusing meanings, moods and tenses]; when, having
said “in the whole earth,'' he adds again “of the whole world,''
as though he wished to include something else, or the sky, which
is part of the world, though a good part of the earth even was not
under Rome; when he distinguishes between providing for “the
faith'' of Christians and providing for their “stability,⁷' as though
they could not coexist31 when he confuses “ordain'' and “decree,''
and when, as though Constantine had not already joined with the
rest in making the decree, he has him now ordain it, and as
though he imposes a punishment, decree [confirm] it, and con-
firm it together with the people. [That, Ι pass by.] But what
Christian could endure this [other thing], and not, rather, criti-
cally and severely reprove a Pope who endures it, and listens to
it willingly and retails it3 namely, that the Roman See, though it
received its primacy from Christ, as the Eighth Synod declared
according to the testimony of Gratian and many of the GreekS,

1 Part of this criticism rests upon the peculiarities of the text of the Donation

· which Valla used.
