4 . ΤΗΕ DONATION OF CONSTANTINE

tion of Constantine (Declamatio de falso credita et ementita dona-
tione Constantini, also referred to as Libellus, and Oratio) in
sfi40, when he was secretary to AlfonSO‚ king of Aragon, Sicily,

and N apleS. It may well be considered as part of the campaign

which that king was conducting against Pope Eugenius IV in ’

· furtherance of his claims to Italian territories.

There has hitherto been no satisfactory text of this treatise. The
first printed edition, that of Ulrich von Hutten, in 1517, is ex-
cessively rare, and it, as well as >its numerous reprintS, is defective
in places. The same is true of the text in the collected works of
Valla, the Opera, printed at Basle, 1540, 1543 (?)‚ The only
English edition, by Thomas Godfray (London‚ 1525 ?)‚ is rare
and of no great merit. A modern French edition by Alcide Bon-
neau (La Donation de Constantin, Paris, 1879) gives the text
with a F rench translation and a long introduction. It is based on
the 1520 reprint of Hutten's edition, is polemical‚ uncritical‚ and
admittedly imperfect. A 'modern edition with translation into
Italian (La dissertazione di Lorenzo Valla su la falsa e manzo-
gnera donazione di Costantino tradotta in Italiano da G. Vincenti,
Naples, 1895) is out of print. ’

My text is based on the manuscript Codex Vaticanus 5314,
dated December 7, 1451, the only complete manuscript of the

κ, treatise Ι have been able to find. I have collated this with

Hutten's text as found in one of the earliest, if not the earliest,
reprint ( contained in the little volume De Donatione Constantini
quid veri habeat, ete., dated 1520 in the Union Theological Semi-
nary library copy, but corresponding closely to the one dated x1518
in E. Bocking's edition of the works of Ulrich von Hutten, vol. I,
p. 18), and have occasionally used readings from Hutten's text or
later oneS‚ such as that of Simon Schard,1 but in every instance
I have indicated the MS. reading. I have used uniform, curre-nt
spelling and punctuation, and have used my own judgment in
paragraphing.

Preceding Valla's treatise I reprint, with a translation, the text

1 syntagma tractatuum de imperiali iurisdictione, etc.‚ Strassburg, 1609; first
published under a similar title at Basle, 1566.
