THE DONATION· OF CONSTANTINE 12 1

people would think that he did notwear a crown “of purest gold
and precious gemS,'' unless he said so?

F ind the reason why he speaks thus: “for the honor of the
blessed Peter.'' As though, not Christ, but Peter, were the chief
corner-stone on which the temple of the church is built; an infer-
ence he later repeats! But if he wanted to honor him so much,
why did he not dedicate the episcopal temple at Rome to him,
rather than to John the Baptist?

What? Does not that barbarous way of talking show that the

rigmarole was composed, not in theEge of Constantine, but later;

2This singular confusion about' the crown in the Donation is explained by
Brunner, Festgabe fiir Rudolf von Gneist‚ pp. 2 5 et seq„ as giving the Pope the
possession, but not the use, of the imperial crown, thus paving the way for his
prerogative of conferring the crown upon Louis the Pious in 816. Scheffer-Boichorst
takes the whole episode as an attempt of the forger to glorify Sylvester by having
the emperor honor him with the imperial crown, and having the Pope display
the clerical humility (and pride) of rejecting it.
