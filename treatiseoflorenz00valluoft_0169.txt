’ THE DoNATION OF CONSTANTINE 157

a marvellous defense! For of which Emperor are you speaking?

F’o'r who does not know that the Latin Emperor was gratuitously
established by a supreme pontifi, Stephen I think, who robbed the
Greek Emperor because he would not aid Italy, and established
a Latin Emperor3 so the EmRe—ror thus rggquedffmoretsrom the
POPRAEh-QB therPope from the ΝΕῇἷρἐιὲζ)’1111011, of course, Achilles
and Patroclus divided the Trojan spoils between themselves alone
on some such terms. The words of Louis [the Pious] seem to me
to imply just this when he saysQI, Louis, Roman Em eror
AugustuS, ordain and grant, by this ompact of our confirmation,
to yon, blessed Peter, prince of the apostleS, and through you to
your vicar, the supreme pontifi, lord Paschal [I], and to his suc-
cessors forever, to hold, just as from our predecessors until now
you have held, under your authority and rule, the Roman state
with its duchy, with all its towns and villageS‚ its mountain dis-
trictS, sea coasts and harborS, and all cities, fortS, walled townS,
and estates in the districts of Tuscany.''2

Do you, Louis, make a pact with Paschal? If these are yourS,
that is, the Roman Empire⁷s, why do you grant them to another?
If they are his and are held in his own possession, what sense is
tffgr'ssjfi'yfq‘ur'bdrififrfiifig' them? How little of the Roman Empire
will be yours if you lose the very head of the Empire? From Rome

Therefore, tthop-Qionof Constantine is not valid at all; that is,
v if you⁷posse⁷ss what was given by him to the pontiff. If it is valid,
By what' right does Paschal give you the rest [of the Empire],
retaining for himself only what vhe possesses? What does your
excessive prodigality toward him at the expense of the Roman
Empire mean, or his toward you? Therefore, deservedly do you

call it a “(Qmpactss' something like collusion.

of Naploe‚ who was in conflict with imperial as well as with papal claims.
