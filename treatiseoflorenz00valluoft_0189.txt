 

THE DONATION OF CONSTANTINE 177

- the balance of debit and credit be determined. But you want to

govern us against our will, as though we were wards of yourS, we

> who perhaps could govern you more wisely than you do yourself ! '

Add to this the wrongs all the time being committed against this
state either by you or by your magistrates We call God to witness
that our wrong drives us to revolt, as once Israel did from Reho-

- boam. And what great wrong did they have? What [a small]

part of our calamity is the [mere] payment of heavier taxes!
What then if you impoverish the Republic? You have impover-
ished it. What if you despoil our temples? You have despoiled
them. What if you outrage maidens and matrons? You have
outraged them. What if you drench the city with the blood of its
citizens? You have drenched it. Must we endure all this? Nay,
rather, since you have ceased to be a father to uS, shall we not
likewise forget to be sons? This people summoned you, supreme
pontifi, to be a father, or if it better pleases you, to be their lord,
not to be an enemy and a hangman3 you do not choose to act the
father or the lord, but the enemy and the hangman. But, since
we are ChristianS, we will not imitate your ferocity and your
impiety, even though by the law of reprisal we might do so, nor
will we bare the avenging sword above your head; but first your
abdication and removal, and then we will adopt another father or
lord. Sons may flee from vicious parents who brought them into
the world; may we not fiee from you, not our real father but an

a adopted one who treats us in the worst way possible? But do you

attend to your priestly functions3 and don⁷t take your stand in
the north, and thundering there hurl your lightning and thunder-
bolts against this people and others.''

But why need I say more in this case, absolutely sels-evident

as it is? I contend that not only did Constantine not grant such
great possessionS, not only could the Roman pontiff not hold

‚ them by prescription, but that even if either were a fact, never-

theless either right would have been extinguished by the crimes

. of the possessors, for we know that the slaughter and devastation
J of all Italy and of many of the provinces has flowed from this
