shame. Why do you defraud your children of their expected suc-
cession to the empire, youv who yourself reigned in partnership
ννίἮρῖἇιῖῆἲἩὲῖῗ 'What have'we done* ⁶'to you? By what 'dis-
loyalty to yOu, to our country, to the Roman name or the majesty
of the empire, are we deemed to deserve to be deprived of the
chiefest and best part of our principality; that we should be
banished from our paternal home, from the sight of our native

that it had been our lot, your Majesty, while your honor and your
victory were unimpaired, to fall in battle, rather than to see this!
