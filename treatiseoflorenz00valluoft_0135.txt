THE DONATION OF CONSTANTINE 123

a glittering tiara of the most dazzling white, representing the
Lord's resurrection. And holding the bridle of his horse, out of
, reverence for the blessed Peter, we performed for him the duty
of squire; decreeing that all his successors, and they alone, use
< this same tiara in processions in imitation of our power.'’

Does not this fable-fabricator seem to blunder, not through
imprudence, but deliberately and of set purpose, and so as to
offer handles for catching him? In the same passage he says
both that the Lord's resurrection is represented by the tiara, and
that it is an imitation of Caesar’s power; two things which differ
most widely from each other. God is my witneSS, I find no wordS,
no words merciless enough with which to stab this most aban-
doned scoundre13 so full of insanity are all the words he vomits
forth. He makes Constantine not only similar in office to MoseS,
who at the command of God honored the chief priest, but also
an expounder of secret mysterieS, a most difficult thing even for
those long versed in the sacred books, Why did you not make
Constantine supreme pontiff while you were about it, as many
emperors have been, that he might more conveniently transfer his
attire to the other high priestR(¹ But you did not know history
And I give thanks to God on tl'ns very score, that he did not s
permit this utterly vicious scheme to be suggested save to an=
exceedingly stupid man. Subsequent considerations also show this.
For he suggests the fact that Moses performed for Aaron, seated
on a horse, the duty of squire [dextratoris], and that in the midst
not of Israel, but of the Canaanites and the EgyptianS, that is,
of an heathen state, where there was not so much a secular
government as one of demons and demon-worshipping peoples.

 

“Wherefore, in order that the supreme pontificato may not
deteriorate, but may rather be adorned with glory and power
even more than is the dignity of an earthly rule; behold, we give
over and relinquish -to the most blessed pontiff and universal
Pope, Sylvester, as well our palace as also the city of Rome and
all the provinces, places and cities of Italy or1 of the western
