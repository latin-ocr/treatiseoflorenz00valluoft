THE DoNATION OF CONSTANTINE 91 ’

and reiterates what he has just said. Is it thus that 1n your age
the secretaties Qf the Caesars spoke, or even their grooms? Con- ,
stantine chose them not‘ ‘as his intercessors'' but‘ ‘to be his inter· κ
cessorS. ” The fellow inserted that “to be'' [esse] so 35 to get

3 more elegant rhythm. A fine reason! To speak barbaxnusly 50

him.1 And he calls the Roman pontifis “vicars'' of Peter, either
35 though Peter were living, or as though they were of lower rank
than was Peter. And is not this barbarous3 “from us and our
empire''?2 As if the empire had 3 mind to give grantS, and power!
Nor was he content to say “should obtain,'’ without also saying
“conceded,'' though either one would have sufficed. And that “con-

them “constant'' so that they may not be corrupted by money
nor moved by sear. And “earthly imperial power''; two adjectives
without a conjunction. And “be honored with veneration'': and
“clemency of our imperial serenity'';3 it smacks of Lactantian elo-

grandeur and majesty, when the power of the Empire is con-

phrase “gloriously exalted'' by “glory, and power, and dignity,
and vigor, and imperial honor''! This seems to be taken from the
Apocalypse, where it sayS, “Worthy is the Lamb that was slain,
to receive power, and divinity and wisdom, and strength, and

honor and blessing.''4 Frequently, as will be shown later, Con-
stantine is made to arrogate to himself the titles of God, and to try

 

1 The conjunction “seu'' in classical Latin meant, as Valla insists‚ “or’'; in the
eighth century it was often used with the meaning “and'' The forger of the

for dating the forgery.
