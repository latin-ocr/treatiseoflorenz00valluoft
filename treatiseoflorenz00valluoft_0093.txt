THE DONATION OF CONSTANTINE 81

very well-known book are involved, and either you do not ques-
tion such an incredible occurrence, or when you do not find 'it
written down you have such utter credulity as to believe that it
is written down and authentic! And, satisfied with this title, you
move heaven and earth, and, as though no doubt existed, you
pursue with the terrors of war and with other threats those who
do not believe you! Blessed Jesus, what power, what divinity

Donation of Constantine, so magnificent and astounding, cannot

the elders expressed the opinion that the world was to be de-
stroyed, once by water, and again by fire, inscribed his teaching
on two columns, one of brick against the fire, and one of stone
against the flood, which columns still remained at the time of
Josephus, as he himself writeS, so that his benefaction to men
might always continue. And among the Romans, while still rustic
and country bred, when writing was inadequate and rare, the
laws of the Twelve Tables nevertheless were engraved on braSS,
and though the city was stormed and burned by the Gauls they „V-
were afterwards found unharmed. Thus careful foresight over-
