6 THE DONATION OF CONSTANTINE

These have shown the existence at Rome, as early as the last of
the sixth century, of the story which forms most of the narrative
part of the Donation, and gave the forger the whole of his back-
round. ’
g The earliest known manuscript of the document is in the Codex
‘Parisiensis Lat. 2778, in the Collectio Sancti Dionysii, found in
the monastery of St. Denis, in France. The collection contains
documents dating from the last years of the eighth century, though
it may have been put together later. ῷθἝὸἨΐΕΓΕΐῬΞῈΠᾶο-Ιεί-
dorean DecretaIS, in which the Donatio was virtually published
to the world, in the middle of the ninth century, also came out in
F rance.¹¹ French writers of the ninth century, aISO, were the first,
so far as we know, to refer to the Donation. Such facts help to fix
the date of the forgery, but under the circumstances they do not
fix the place as France. Rather they are merely another illustra-
tion of the well-known leadership of France in learning and
politics during the ninth century. ⁴
Linguistic peculiarities of the document have been most exhaus-
tively treated by one of the greatest of critical historians, Paul
Scheffer-Boichorst,1 not to speak of briefer studies by Dollinger,
Brunner, and others. In the full text of the Donation, as for in-
stance the one published by Zeumer, are found many features
distinctive of Italian documents of the eighth century, and a num-
ber that apparently are peculiar to the chancellery of Stephen II
(III), Bishop of Rome 752-757, and of Paul I (757-767), more
particularly the latter. (Some of these do not occur in the passages
and the text which Valla used3 that is, in his copy of Gratian's
Decretum.) This is true in varying degrees of particularity of the
form or usage of the following words3 synclitus (for senatus) in

constitutum (decretum) in ἓξ 17 and 18, retro (applied to the
future) in ἓξ 1 and 19, largitas (possessiofifi ἓ 13, consul and
