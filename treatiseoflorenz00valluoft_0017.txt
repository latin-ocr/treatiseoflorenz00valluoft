 

THE DONATION OF CONSTANTINE 5

OQ 35 given, with the omission of long sections, in
Gratian' 5 Decretum, or Concordia discordantium canonum, which
was the forQ Valla used and on which he based his criticismn Ι
take it from A Frffffdbergffi-edition-of-fflefofpsis—Ififfs—-Cffii,
vol. I, columns 342 34 5. The full text of the Donation is best
given by Karl Zeumer‚ in the Festgabe fiir Rudolf von Gneist
(Julius Springer‚ Berlin, 1888), pp. 47- 59, reprinted among other
places in my Constantine the Great and Christianity, pp. 228-2 37.
The document may be studied to advantage also in the Decretales
Pseudo-Isidorianae et Capitula Angilramni, ed. Hinschius (Leip-
sic, 1863). An English translation, from Zeumer's text, is in E. F.
Henderson's Select Historical Documents of the Middle AgeS,
pp. 319-329.

In the translation of passages of the Donation I have, so far as
possible, used the words of Henderson's translation. In quotations
from the Bible I have used the King James version. In translating
Valla's quotations from the Donation I have usually, though not
alwayS, followed him in giving words their Classical and not their
medieval meaning.

The Donation of Constantine grew out of the legends about
Sylvester Ι, Bishop of Rome, as well as out of legends about Con-
’ stantine. These are described at length in Constantine the Great
and Christianity. The most familiar form of the Sylvester-Con-
stantine legend is that of Mombritius' Sanctuarium, sive Vitae
collectae excodibus, Milan, c. 1470, vol. II, folio 279: Paris, 1910,
vol. II, pp. 508-5 31.

Present-day scholarship is not in entire agreement on all points
connected with the Donation of Constantine. The following sum-
mary, however, may be hazarded. The problem oi modern criti-
cism, of course, is, not to establish the spuriousness of the
Donation,—that has long been obviOUS,--but to locate the origin
of the document as closely as possible.

The development of the Sylvester-Constantine legend was
worked out best by Dollinger (Papstfabeln des Mittelalters, Mu-
nich, 1863: ed., J. Friedrich, Stuttgart, 1890) and by Duchesne
(in his edition of the Liber Pontificalis, vol. I, 1886, pp. cvii-cxx).
