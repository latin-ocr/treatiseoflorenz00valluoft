endure to become Christians, but you will make the name hateful,
detestable, execrable to uS, and you will put us in such a position
that at last you will pity our life and our death, nor will you
χ accuse uS, but only yourself‚ of obstinacy.''

Would not Constantine, unless we would have him totally Ι
’ὀθνοίἀ of humanity, if he were not moved of his own accord,
have been moved by this speech? But if he had not been willing ζ
to listen to these men, would there not have been those who would
oppose this act with both word and deed? Or would the Senate
andbthe Roman people have thought that they had no obligation
to do anything in a matter of such importance? Would it not have
put forward some orator “distinguished in character and service‚''
as Virgil sayS, who would hold forth to Constantine as follows:

“Your Majesty, if you are heedless of your subjects and of

your blood, but from oursl Will you cut one body into two partS,
and out of one kingdom make two kingdomS, two heads, two wius,
and, as it were, reach out to two brothers swords with which to
fight over their inheritance! We give to states which have de-
served well of this city the rights of citizenship, so that they may
be Roman citizens; you take away from us the half of the empire,
so that they will not know this city as their mother. In beehives, if
two kings are born, we kill the weaker one, but in the hive os the
Roman Empire, where there is one prince, and that the best, you
think that another must be introduced, and that the weakest one,
not a bee, but a drone.1

“We see a sore lack of prudence on your part, your Majesty.
For what will happen, if either during your life or after your
death, war should be waged by barbarian tribes against the part
of the empire which you are alienating, or against the other,
