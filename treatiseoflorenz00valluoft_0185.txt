destroy a true title. Or indeed, if Ι were captured by barbarians
and supposed to have perishe'd, and should return again home
after a hundred years of captivity, as a claimant of my paternal
inheritance, should Ι be excluded? What could be more inhuman!
And, to give another example, did Jephthah, the leader of Israel,
when the Ammcffsite‘s‘fie'manded back the land from‘ ‘the borders
of Arnon even unto Jabbok and unto Jordan,'' reply,‘ ‘Israel has
prescribed this now through three hundred years' occupation’'?
Or did he not show that the land which they demanded as theirs,
had never been theirs, but had been the Amorites'? And the proof
that it did not belong to the Ammonites was that they had never
in the course of so many years claimed it.1

The Roman church has prescribed! Keep still, impious tongue!
You transfer “prescription,'' which is used of inanimate, senseless
objectS, to man; and holding man in servitude is the more detest-
able, the longer it lasts. Birds and wild animals do not let them-
selves be “prescribed,’' but however long the time of captivity,
when they please and occasion is offered, they escape. And may
not man, held captive by man, escape?

Let me tell why the Roman pontifis show fraud and craft rather
than ignorance in using war instead of law as their arbiter,—
and Ι believe that the first pontiffs to occupy the city [of Rome]
and the other towns did about the same. Shortly before Ι was
born, Rome was led by an incredible sort of fraud, I CssngjhOSC s
then Erfisent there to witneSS, to accept papal government ors
rather usurpation, after it had long been free.2 The Pope was
Boniface IX, fellow of Boniface VIII in fraud as in name,—if
they are to be called Boniface (benefactor) at all, who are the
worst malefactorS. And when the Romans, after the treachery
had been detected, stirred up trouble, the good Pope, after the
manner of Tarquinius, struck off all the tallest poppies with his
stick.⁸ When his successor, Innocent [VII], afterwards tried to

⁸ Tarquinius, by striking down the tallest poppies with his cane, gave the hint
that the leaders of the opposition should be executed; cf. Livy, I, 54.
