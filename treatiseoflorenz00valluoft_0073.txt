THE DONATION OF CONSTANTINE 61

sentence of his, which he spoke as though to me and to you;
‘Render unto Caesar the things which are Caesar's3 and unto God,
the things that are God'S.'1 Accordingly, therefore, your Majesty‚
you must not surrender the things that are yours, and I must not
accept the things that are Caesar's; nor will I ever accept them,

’ though you offer them a thousand timeS.''

*To this speech of Sylvester'S‚ worthy of an apostolic hero, what ς’

could there be further for Constantine to bring out in opposition?

Since the case stands thuS‚ do not they who say that the Donation Δ

took place do violence to Constantine when they would have him
rob his own family and tear the Roman Empire asunder? Do they

not do violence to the Senate and the Roman people‚ -t-QJOEIW and .
to the whole West, which according to them allowed thffffiffi

ment to be changed contrary to law and justice? Do they not do

violence to Sylvester‚ who according to them accepted a gift not . s

befitting a holy man? violence to the supreme pontificate‚ when

they think that it would take charge of earthly kingdoms and

rule over the Roman Empire? Verily‚ all this tends to show

plainly that Constantine, in the face of so many obstacleS, would

never have thought of giving practically the whole Roman state
to Sylvester‚ as they say he did.

Proceed to the next point3 to make us believe in this “dona- ,

tion'’ which your document reciteS‚ something ought still to be

extant concerning Sylvester's acceptance of it. There is nothing ζ
concerning it extant. But it is believable‚ you say, that he recog- '⁴

nized this “donation.'' I believe 80, too; that [if it was given] he
not only recognized it, but sought it, asked for it, extorted it with
his prayers; that 1s believable. But why do you reverse the natural
conjecture and then say it is believable? For the fact that there 1s

*ψη-’,1- ‘—

mention of the donation 1n the document of the deed ls no reason ff!

for inferring that it was accepted; but on the contrary, the fact ” ᾧ

that there ls no mention [anywhere] of an acceptance is reason
for saying that there was no donation. So you have stronger proof
