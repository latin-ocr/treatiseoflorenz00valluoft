‘THE DONATION OF CONSTANTINE 3

nal text and translation, so that the reader may judge sor him-
self. A critical appraisal would have to take into account that
Nicholas Cusanus some seven years earlier in his De concordantia
catholica covered part of the same ground even better than Valla
did, and anticipated some of his arguments. But Valla's treatise is
more exhaustive‚ is in more finished and effective literary form,
and in effect established for the world generally the proof of the
falsity of the Donation. Moreover‚ for the first time, he used effec-
tively the method of studying the usage of words in the variations
of their meaning and application‚ and other devices of internal
criticism which are the tools of historical criticism to-day. So,

ff while Valla' s little book may seem slight beside later masterpieces

of investigation and beside systematic treatises in larger fields, it⁶
is none the less a landmark m the rise of a new seience. I speak‘
from personal experience in adding that it is still useful 1n college
classes in promoting respect for, and development in, critical
scholarship.

As to Valla himself the words of Erasmus will bear repetition3
“Valla, a man who with so much energy, zeal and labor, refuted
the stupidities of the barbariam, saved half-buried letters from
extinction, restored Italy to her ancient splendor of eloquence, and
forced even the learned to express themselves henceforth with
more circumspection.''1 The Italian Renaissance is much extolled
among US‚—and so little known. A short time ago diligent search

⁷ revealed no copy of Valla's works in the United StateS, and many

of the larger libraries had none of his separate writingS. The same
is doubtless true in the case of other great names in the Renais-
sance. Meanwhile, there are those whose profession it is to teach
European history and who are utterly unacquainted with medieval
'and later Latin.

The best life of Valla 1s that by Girolamo Mancini.2 There 1s no
satisfactory account of him 1n English
