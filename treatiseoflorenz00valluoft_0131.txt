THE DONATION OF CONSTANTINE 119

[i.e.‚ regularv clergy3 or perhaps cardinals]: let no one whomso-
ever presume to act in a domineering way in this.''1

Who 1s this Melchizedek that blesses the patriarch Abraham?
Does Constantine stcareely yet a Christian, give to the man by
whom he was baptized and whom he calls blessed, authority to
make priests? Α5 though Sylvester had not and could not have
done it before! And with what a threat he forbids any one to
stand 1n the Ἓν( ‘Let no one, whomsoever, presume to act in a
domineering way in this matterss' What elegant diction, too!

“Enroll in the pious number of the religious'' 3 and‘ ‘clericare,''
“clericorum,'' “indictu,'' and “placatus''1
And again he comes back to the diadem:

“We also therefore decreed this, that he himself and his suc-
cessors might use, for the honor of the blessed Peter, the diadem, ΙΙ

of purest gold and precious gemS.⁷' s

 

θ Againvhe-exffiaiaenffisgthe meaning of diadem, for he was speaking

gold,'' lest-perchanceyou should think brass or dross was mixed,
in. And when he has said “gems,'' he adds “preciouS,'' again
{garing lest you should suspect them of being cheap. Yet why did
he not say most preciouS, just as he said “purest gold''? For there
is more difference between gem and gem, than between gold and
gold. And when he should have said “distinctum gemmis,'' he
said “ex gemmi5.'' Who does not see that this was taken from
the passage, which the gentile ruler had not read, “Thou settest
a crown of precious stone on his head”?² Did the Caesar speak
thus, with a certain vanity in bragging of his crown, if indeed the
Caesars were crowned, but cheapening himself by fearing lest

1 Valla’s text of the Donation in this paragraph differs greatly from Zeumer’s,
Hinschius’, and Friedberg's. It is not very clear in any of the texts whether the
intent is to give the Pope power to take any one whomsoever into the clergy and
thus relieve him from civil and military duties, or to prevent the Roman nobility
from forcing their way into ecclesiastical officoe against the will of the Pope.
