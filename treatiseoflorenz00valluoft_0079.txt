th, nor th, nor how long it lasteffiou would think that
Sylvester reigned in sylvan shadeS, among the treeS, not at Rome
nor among men, and that he was driven out by winter rains and
cold, not by men! -
, Who that is at all widely read, does not know what Roman

Kings, what consuls, what dictatorS, what tribunes of the people‚
what censors, what aediles were chosen? Of such a large number
of men in times so long past, none escapes uS. We know also
what Athenian commanders there were, and Theban, and Lace-
demonian; we know all their battles on land and sea. Nor are the
kings of the Persians unknown to us; of the Medes; oi the Chal-
deans; of the Hebrews; and of very many others; nor how each
of these received his kingdom, or held it, or lost it, or recovered it.

how it ended, when, through whom, is not known even in the city

 

of Rome itself. Ι ask whether you can adduce any witnesses of
these eventS, any writers. None, you answer. And are you not
ashamed to say that it is likely that Sylvester possessed—even
cattle, to say nothing of men!

But since you cannot [prove anything], I for my part will
show that Constantine, to the very last day of his life, and there-
after all the Caesars in turn, did have possession [of the Roman ³ “ ‚
Empire] , so⁷ that you will have nothing left even to mutter. But it Ιχ) “ff'‘“tss
is a very difficult, and, Ι suppose, a very laborious task, forsooth, ..st-mm-
to do this! Let all the Latin and the Greek histories be unrolled,ss *ff*
let the other authors who mention those times be brought in, and
you will not find a single discrepancy among them on this points
Of a, thousand> ν1737130055ᾼο5, one may suffice; EutropiuS, who saw
Constantine, who saw the three sons of Constantine who were left
