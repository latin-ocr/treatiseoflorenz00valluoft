QQQQQQQG earthjnto four parts and enumerate
the countries of each, Ρ111 when we divide it into three, Asia,
Africa, Europe that 15, unless you say Asia for the province of

the lights without the rest of the world contributing!

I pass over the fact that you say these are granted as a gift, and

also the shoulder-band,—that is, the strap that usually surrounds
