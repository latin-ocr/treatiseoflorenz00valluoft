THE DONATION OF CONSTANTINE 155

science does not admit;¹] unless they attribute this to the Capito-
line godS, as though they were wont to talk and had ordered this
to be done!

But why should I wonder that the pontifis are not informed on
these points, when they do not know about their own name! For
they say that Peter is called Cephas because he was the head 01
1110 apostles, as though this noun were Greek, from κεφαλή, and
not Hebrew, or rather Syriac; a noun which the Greeks write
κηφᾶς, and which with them means rock (Petrus), and not head!
For “petrus,'' “petra,'' (rock) is a Greek noun. And “petra'' is
stupidly explained by them through a Latin derivation, as from
“pede trita'' (trodden by foot) 1 And they distinguish “metropoli-
tan'' from “archbishop,'' and claim that the former is so called
from the size 01 1110 city, though in Greek it is not called
μετρόπολις but μητρόπολις, 1113115, 1110 111011101-51310 01 city. And
they explain “patriarch'' as “pater patrum'' (father 01 13111015);
and “papa'' (pope) from the interjection “pape'' (indeed); and
“orthodox'' as from the words meaning “right glory''; and they
pronounce “Simonem'' (Simon) with a short middle vowel,
though it should be read with, a long oue, as are “HQ’'
(Plato) and “Catonem'' (Cato). And there are many similar
instances which I paSS, lest 101 1110 fault 01 501110 01 1110 supreme
pontifis I should seem to attack all. These 11151311005 had to be

given so that no one should wonder 11131 many 01 1110 Popes have

been unable to detect that the Donation 01 Constantine was

spurious3 though, in my opinion, this QssssQqssfflnated with

1 This clause, though not in the MS. or Hutten‚ seems necessary to the sense
01 1110 following clause, so 1 have translated it from Bonneau's text. In the Vita
silvestri we are told that the pagan priests ordered Constantine to bathe in
infants’ blood in order to cure himself 01 1ορ1ο5Υ. Cf. Coleman, Constantine the
Great, etc„ p. 162.
