THE DONATION OF CONSTANTINE 145 ’

a spacious city as Rome; the more remarkable that the serpent

. was down in a cavern so deep that one descended to it by a hun-
dred and fifty steps? SerpentS, excepting possibly the basilisk,
inject their poison and kill, not with their breath, but with their
bite. Cato, fleeing from Caesar through the very midst of the
African deserts with such a large force as he had, did not see any
of his company slain by the breath of a serpent, either on the
march or in camp; nor do the natives think the air pestilential on
account of serpentS. And if we believe at all in the storieS, the
Chimaera, the Hydra and Cerberus have all often been seen and
touched without injury.

Why hadn't the Romans already slain it instead [of waiting
for Sylvester]? They couldn't, you say? But Regulus killed a
much larger serpent in Africa on the banks of the Bagradas And
it was very easy indeed to kill the one at Rome; for instance, by
closing the mouth of the cavern. Or didn’t they want to? Ah, they
worshipped it as a god, Ι suppose, as the Babylonians did? Why
then, as Daniel is said to have killed that serpent,1 had not Syl-
vester killed this one when he had bound him with a hempen
thread, and destroyed that brood forever? The reason the inventor
of the legend did not want the dragon slain was that it might not
be apparent that he had copied the narrative of Daniel. But if
Jerome, a most learned and accurate translator, ApollinariS,
Origen, Eusebius and others affirm the story of Bel to be
apocryphal, if the Jews in their original of the Old Τ estament do
not know it; that is, is all the most learned of the Latins, most
of the Greeks, and certain of the Hebrews, condemn that as a
legend, shall'I not condemn this adumbration of it, which is not
based on the authority of any writer, and which far surpasses its
model in absurdity?

For who had built the underground home for the beast? Who
had put it there and commanded it not to come out and fiy away
(for dragons fly, as some say; even though others deny it)? Who
had thought out that kind of food for him? Who had directed

Α that women, virgins at that, devoted to chastity, go down to him,
