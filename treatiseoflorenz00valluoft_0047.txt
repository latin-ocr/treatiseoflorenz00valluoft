 

THE DONATIQN OF CONSTANTINE · 35

case3 you were led to do as you did solely for the glory 01 your
religion. As though it were more religious to lay down a kingdom
than to administer it for the maintenance 01 religion! For so far

'v ⁴ as it concerns the recipientS, that Donation will be neither hon· ,
orable nor useful to them. But if you want to show yourself as “¹⁰⁵ ³ j ‘

and would Constantine have presented the half 01 his empire?
I regret to reply to this shameless story as though it were un-
doubted and historical, soritis a reflection of the story 01 Naaman
and Elisha3 just as that other story about the dragon is a reflec-

enormous serpent, finally subdued by the saint. Cf. infra, p. 143; Coleman‚ Con-
