ΤΗΕ DONATION OF CON STANlTIN E 29

siderable, for the mere subsistence of the Pope. F ourth that it is
not true either that a copy of the Donation 15 found in the De-

Ι cretum [of GratianJ, or that it was taken from the History of
Sylvester3 for it is not found in it or in any history, and it is
comprised of contradictionS, 1111Ρο551111111165 stupidities, 1131- ,

1131151115 and absurd1t1es F urther I shall speak os the pretended
or mock donatiOn of certain other Caesars. Then by way of re-
dundance I shall add that even had Sylvester taken possession,
nevertheleSS, he or some other pontifi having been dispossessed,
possession could not be resumed after such 3 long interval under
either divine or human law. Last [I shall show] that the posses-
sions which are now held by the supreme pontifi could not, in
any length of time, be validated by prescription.

I choose to address an audience, as it were, face to face. I call
upon you, kings and princes, for it is difficult for a private person

to form a picture of a royal mind3 I seek your thought, Ι search ·
your heart, I ask your testimony. Is there any one of you wh0, ἰ

betaking himself thence to an humble little town, Byzantium; ’
giving with Rome Italy, not a province but the mistress of
provinces; giving the three Gauls; giving the two Spains; the
Germans; the Britons; the whole West3 deprivingf imself of one
of the two eyes of his empire? That any one in possession of his

peopleS, the victor of the nations, whose very form is
