’ THE DoNATION OF CONSTANTINE 147

. and only on the Kalends? Or did the serpent remember what day

was the Kalends? And was he content with such scant and occa-
sional food? And did not the virgins dread such a deep cavern,

and a beast so monstrous and greedy? I suppose the serpent μ

wheedled them, as they were women, and virgins, and brought
him his victuals3 Ι suppose he even chatted with them. What if,
pardon the expression, he even had intercourse with them3 for
both Alexander and Scipio are said to have been born by the
embrace of a dragon, or a serpent, with their mothersl Why, if
food were afterward denied him, would he not have come out
then, or have died?

O the strange folly of men who have saith in these senile
ravingsl How long now had this been going on? When did the
beginning occur? Before the advent of the Savior, or after? As
to this, nothing is known We should be ashamed! We should be
ashamed of these silly songs, and this frivolity worse than dan-
gerous! A Christian, who calls himself a son of truth and light,
should blush to utter things which not only are not true, but are
notssredible.

But, they say, the demons obtained this power over the heathen,
so as to mock them for serving the godS. Silence, you utter
ignoramu'seS, not to call you utter rascaIS, you who always spread
such a veil over your stories! True Christianity does not need the
patronage of falsehood3 it is malntalned satisfactorily by itself,
and by its own light and truth‚ without those lying and deceitful
fables ,--unmitigated insults to God, to Christ, and to the Holy
§pitin Would God thus have given the human race over into
the power of demonS, to be seduced by such evident, such impos-
ing miracleS, that he might well-nigh be accused of the injustice of
turning sheep over to wolveS, and that men should have good
excuse for their errors? But if so much license was once given
demonS, even more would be given them now among infidels3
which is by no means the case, nor are any legends of this sort
told by them.

Passing by other peoples, Igmwill speak of the Romans. Among
them the miracles reported are few, and they early and obscure.
