arms prevails, because that which is acquired by armS, is likewise
lost by armS.

This, indeed, the more, that other, new, peoples as we have
heard in the case of the Goths, who were never subject to Roman
rule, after putting to flight the earlier inhabitantS, seized upon
Italy and many provinces What justice, pray, is there in restor-
ing these to a servitude which they have never experienced;
especially as they are the conquering peoples; and to servitude
perchance under the conquered peoples? And if at this time any
cities and nationS, deserted by the Emperor at the arrival of the
barbariam, as we know to have been the case, had been compelled
to elect a king under whose leadership they then won victory,
is there any reason why they should later depose this ruler? Or
should they bid his sonS, popular it may be for their father⁷s
praise, it may be for their own valor, become private citizenS,
that they might again become subjects of a Roman prince, even
though they were greatly in need of their assistance and hoped for
no aid elsewhere? -If-QQ-Caefiflf himself, or Constantine, returned

to life, or even the Senate and Roman people should call them .

before a general court such as the Amphictyony was in Greece,

[the plamt1ff ] would at once be ruled out at his first plea because .

he was reclaiming to bondage and slavery those who once had been
abandoned by him, their guardian, those who for a long time had
been living under another ruler, those who had never been sub—
ject to a foreign— b—orn king, men, in conclusion, who were free-
born and proclaimed free by their vigor of mind and body. How
clear it should be, that if the Caesar, if the Roman people‚ is
thus debarred from recovering control, much more decidedly is
the Pope! And if the other nations which have been subject to
Rome are free either to appoint a king for themselves or to main-
tain a republic, far more are the Roman people themselves free

’ ’ to do this, especially against the innovation of papal tyranny.

Estopped from defending the Donation, since it never existed
andjif it had existed, it would now have expired from lapse of
time, our adversaries take refuge in another kind of defense;
