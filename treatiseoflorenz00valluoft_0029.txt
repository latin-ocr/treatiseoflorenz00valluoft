THE DONATION OF CONSTANTINE 17

might use and bear upon their heads--to the praise of God for
the honor of the Blessed Petere—the diadem, that is, the crown
which we have granted him from our own head, of purest gold
and precious gemS. But since he himself, the most blessed Pope,
did not at all allow that crown of gold to be used over the clerical
crown which he wears to the glory of the Blessed Peter, we placed
upon his most holy head, with our own hands, a glittering tiara
of dazzling white representing the Lord's resurrection, and hold-

emperor should have jurisdiction ἓ. 8. We decree, moreover, that
all these things, which through is our sacred imperial [charter]
and through other godlike decrees we have established and con-
firmed, remain inviolate and unshaken unto the end of the world.
Wherefore, before the living God who commanded us to reign,
and in the face of his terrible judgment, we entreat‚ through this
our imperial sanction, all the emperors our successorS, and all the
nobleS‚ the satraps aISO, the most glorious senate, and all the
