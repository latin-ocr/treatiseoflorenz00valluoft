THE DONATION OF CON ST ANTINE 33

we read of‘men being put in charge of a kingdom or of cities by

. some king or by the people‚ this is not done in the case of the chief

or the greatest portion of the empire, but in the case of the last
and least, as it were, and that with the understanding that the
recipient should always recognize the donor as 1115 sovereign and
himself as an agent.

Now Ι ask, do they not seem of a base and most ignoble mind ³
