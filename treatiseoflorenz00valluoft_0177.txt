THE DONATION OF CONSTANTINE 165

that the people of Israel were permitted to revolt from the house
of David and Solomon whom prophets sent by God had anointed,
because their impositions were too heavy; and that God approved
their act? May we not revolt on account of such great tyranny‚

⁴ particularly from those who are not kings, and cannot be; and
who from being shepherds of the sheep, that is to say, os souls,
have become thieves and brigands?

And to come to human law, who does not know that there is
no right conferred by war, or if there is any, that it prevails just
as long as you possess what you have gotten by war? For when
you lose possession, you have lost the right. And so ordinarily,
if captives have escaped no one summons them into court: and so
also with plunder if the former owners have recovered it. Bees
and any other kind of winged creatureS, if they have flown away
far from my property and have settled on another'S, cannot
be reclaimed. And do you seek to reclaim men, who are not only )

 

free creatureS, but masters of others, when they set themselves
free by force of arms, [reclaim them] not by force of armS, but
by law, as though you were a man, and they sheep?

Nor can you say, “The Romans were [considered] just in

waging wars against the nationS, and just in depriving them of N θ
liberty.'' Do not drag me into that discussion, lest I be forced to
speak against my fellow Romans, However, no fault could be so
serious that people should merit everlasting servitude therefor.
And in this connection [one must remember also] that people
often waged a war for which a prince or some important citizen
in the Republic was to blame, and, being conquered, were un-
deservedly punished with servitude. There are everywhere abun-
dant examples of this.

Nor in truth does the law of nature provide that one people γ’)
should subjugate another people to itself. We can instruct otherS,
we can urge them3 we cannot rule them and do them violence,
unless, leaving humanity aside, we wish to copy the more savage
beasts which force their bloody rule upon the weaker, as the lion
among quadrupedS, the eagle among birds, the dolphin among
fish. Yet even these creatures do not vaunt authority over their
