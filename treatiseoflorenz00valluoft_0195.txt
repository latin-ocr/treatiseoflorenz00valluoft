THE DONATION OF CONSTANTINE 183

himself a Christian can calmly bear this?

However‚ in this my first discourse I do not wish to urge princes
and peoples to restrain the Pope in his unbridled course as he
roams about, and 'compel him to stay within 'bound5‚ but only
to warn him, and perh-aps he has already learned the truth, to
betake himself from others' houses to his own, and to put to port
before the raging billows and savage tempests, But if he refuseS‚ ,
then I will have recourse to another discourse far bolder than *
this.1 If only I may sometime see, and indeed I can scarcely wait
to see it, especially if it is brought about by my counsel‚ if only
1· may see the time when the Pope is the vicar of Qrist alo -s
HQ If only there would no longer be heard the
fearful cry, artisans for the Church,'' “Partisans against the
Church,’' “The Church against the Perugians,’' ‘against the Bo-
lognese'' 1 It is not the church‚ but the Pope, that fights against s l*

Christians3 the church fights against spmtual ν’νῖἿξέὀΠε55 in - -

high plaees3’2 Then the Pope will be the Holy Father m fact as τ, 2
well as in name, Father of all, Father of the church; nor will
he stir up wars among ChristianS, but those stirred up by others
he, through his apostolic judgment and papal prerogative‚ will
stop.³
