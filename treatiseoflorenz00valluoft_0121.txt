THE DONATION OF CONSTANTINE Ι 109

“purple'' [pupura], however, is a fish in whose blood wool is
dyed‚ and so from the dye the name has been given to the eloth,
whose color can be called red, though it may rather be blackish
and very nearly the color of clotted blood, a sort of violet. Hence
by Homer and Virgil blood is called purple, as is porphyry, the
color of which is similar to amethyst3 for the Greeks call purple
“porphyra’' You know perhaps that scarlet is used for red; but
I would swear that you do not know at all why he makes it

“coccineum'' when we say “coccum‚'' or what sort of a garment a ’

“mande'' [chlamys] is.

But that he might not betray himself as a liar by continuing
longer on the separate garments, he embraced them all together
in a single word, saying, “all the imperial raiment.’' What! even
that which he is accustomed to wear in war, in the chase, at ban-
quetS, in games? What could be more-stupid than to say that all
the raiment of the Caesar befits a pontifi!

But how gracefully he adds, “and the same rank as those pre-
siding over the imperial cavalry.'' He says “seu'' [“or'' for “and''] ,¹
He wishes to distinguish between these two in turn, as if they
were very like each other, and slips along from the imperial rai-
ment to the equestrian rank, saying—I know not what! He
wants to say something wonderful, but fears to be caught lying,
and so with puffed cheeks and swollen throat, he gives forth
sound without sense.

“Conferring also on him the imperial sceptreS.'' What a turn
of speech! What splendor! What harmony! What are these im-
perial sceptres? There is one sceptre‚ not several; if indeed the
Emperor carried a sceptre at all. Will now the pontiff carry a
sceptre in his hand? Why not give him a sword a150, and helmet
and javelin? Δ

“And at the same time all the standards and banners.'' What
do you understand by “standards'’ [signa]? “Signa'' are either
statues (hence frequently we read “signa et tabulas'' for pieces

1 Here, as was common in medieval Latin, “seu’' is the equivalent of “et,'' and
means “and’‘ Valla's criticism is correct, but might go further in fixing the time
of the forgery. Cf. supra, p. 91, note 1.
