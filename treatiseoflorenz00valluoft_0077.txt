THE DONATION OF CONSTANTINE 6 5

until the old magistrates are removed and the new ones sub-
stituted. If then Sylvester had not demanded that this be done,
nevertheless the dignity of Constantine required that he show
that he gave possession not in words but in fact, that he ordered

⁷ his officers to retire and others to be substituted by Sylvester.

Possession is not transferred when it remains in the hands of

those who had it before, and the new master dares not remove{
them.

But grant that this also does not stand in the way, that, not· ⁷ x

withstanding, we assume Sylvester to have been in possession, and

let us say that the whole transaction took place though not in ζ J

sedition afsd murder, or without these? Did the nations conspire „
together against him, or which first? What! Did not one of them,
give him aid, not {nemos those who had been put over cities or
provlnces byj lvester or „QQQ Rape? Did he lose everything
in a single day, or gradually and by dlstricts³ Did he and his
magistrates offer reSistance, or did they abdicate at the first dis-
turbance? What! Did not the victors use the sword on those dregs

of humanity, whom they thought unworthy of the Empire, to

revenge their outrage, to make sure of the newly won mastery, to
