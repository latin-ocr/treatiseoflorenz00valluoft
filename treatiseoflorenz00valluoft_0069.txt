THE DONATION OF CON ST ANTINE 57

“Know this, your Majesty; God formerly established judges
over Israel, not kings3 and he hated the people for demanding a
king for themselves, And he gave them a king on account of
the hardness of their heartS, but only because he permitted their
rejectionJ which h'e reVOked' 1n the new law. And should Ι accept
a kingdom, who am scarcely permitted to be a judge? ‘Or do ye
not know,' says Paul, ‘that the saints shall judge the world? and
if the world shall be judged by you, you are not the ones to judge

a. pontifi, a vicar of Christ? Rather I should hear him thunder out
against me, saying, ‘My house shall be called of all nations the
house of prayer, but ye have made it a den of thieves.'³ ‘I am not

should be settled inside the church, and that even the humblest Christians are
competent to act as J'udges; Valla quotes him to show that church leaders are not
to be Judges.
