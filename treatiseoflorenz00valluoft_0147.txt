THE DONATION OF CONSTANTINE 135

admits was done aiter the burial, so to say, of the recordS, be
contained in the records? This is nothing else than saying that
“the page of the privilege’' was dead and buried before it was
born, and yet never returned from death and burial; and saying
expressly that it was confirmed before it had been written, and
not with one hand alone at that, but with both of the Caesar's
hands! And what is this “confirming’'? Was it done with the sig-
nature of the Caesar, or with his signet ring? Surely, hard and
fast that,—more so by far than if he had entrusted it to bronze
tablets! But there is no need of bronze inscription, when the
charter is laid away above the body of the blessed Peter. But why
do you here suppress Paul, though he lies with Peter, and the two
could guard it better than if the body of one alone were present?

You see the malicious artfulness of the cunning Sin0n11

Because the Donation of Constantine cannot be produced, there- ⁶
fore'lie said that the‘ prlvllege is not on bronze but on paper

records3 therefore he said that it lies with the body of the most
ffapostle so that either we should not dare to seek it in the
venerable tomb, or if we should seek it, we would think it rotted
awffyss‘Bsut where then was the body of the blessed Peter? Cer-

tainly it was not yet in the temple where it now is, not in a place
reasonably protected and safe. T herefore the Caesar would not
have put the‘ ‘’page '.there Or did he not trust the‘ ‘page' ’to the'
most blessed Sylvester, as not holy enough, not careful nor

κ diligent enough? O Peter! O Sylvesterl O holy pontifis of the

Roman church! to whom the sheep of the Lord were entrusted,
thy-ou not keep the‘ ‘page' 'entrusted to you? Why have
you suffered it to be eaten by worms, to rot away with mold? I
Ρτεεῂηἱέἶᾘεὶ 1t was because your bodies also have wasted away.

...- Constantine therefore acted foolishly. Behold the‘ ‘page' 'reduced

to dust, the right conferred by the “privilege'' at the same time
passes away into dust.

And yet, as we see, a copy of the “page'’ is shown. Who then
was so bold as to take it from the bosom of the most holy apostle?
No one did it, I think. Whence then the copy? By all means some
