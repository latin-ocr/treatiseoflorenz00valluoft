THE DONATION OF CONSTANTINE 59

men's death, I to whom in the person of Peter it was said, ‘Put
up again -thy sword into his place, for all they that take the sword
shall perish with the sword'?1 Itis not permitted us even to defend
ourselves with the sword, for Peter wished only to defend his
Lord, when he cut off the servant's ear. And do you command us
to use the sword for the sake of either getting or keeping riches?

“Our authority is the authority of the keys, as the Lord said,

‘I will give unto thee the keys of the kingdom of heaven: and
whatsoever thou shalt bind on earth shall be bound in heaven:

and whatsoever thou shalt loose on earth shall be loosed in
heaven.'2 ‘And the gates of hell shall not prevail against it.'3
Nothing can be added to this authority, nor to this dignity‚ nor to

, the word of God, not with a sword of iron, that they should not be
made worse than they are, nor kick, nor gore me, nor, angered by

most beloved sonS, not my slaves3 to adopt them, not cast them
out; to have them born again, not to seize them out of hand; to
offer their souls a sacrifice to God, not their bodies a sacrifice to
the devil. ‘Come unto me,' says the Lord, ‘for I am meek and lowly
in heart. Take my yoke upon yon, and ye shall find rest sor your
souIS. For my yoke is easy and my burden is light.'⁵
