source of all honors and dignitieS. F urthermore we know that
Paul I was extremely devoted to the memory of Sylvester‚ and so

I wish to give public expression of my thanks to Professor
Deane P. Lockwood‚ of Columbia University‚ for his kindness in
reading my translation of Valla's treatise and the many sugges-
tions and improvements he indicated; to ProfessorJ. T. Shotwell,
of Columbia University‚ who was largely responsible for the be-
ginning of the whole undertaking; and to Mr. Alexander D.
F raser, of A'llegheny College‚ for generous assistance in reading
proof.
