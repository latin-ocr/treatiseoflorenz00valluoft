ΤΗΕ DONATIQN OF CONSTANTINE 31

more pleasing, more grateful, than for you to increase your em-
pires and kingdomS, and to extend your authority as far and
wide as possible? In this, as it seems to me, all your care, all your
thought, all your labor, rnight and day is expended. From this
comes your chief hope of glory, for this you renounce pleasures;
for this you subject yourselves to a thousand dangers; for this
your dearest pledgeS, for this your own flesh you sacrifice with
serenity. Indeed, Ι have neither heard nor read of any of you
having been* deterred from' an attempt to extend his empire
byssloss of an eye, a hand, a leg, or any other member. Nay, this
very ardor and this thirst for wide dominion is such that whoever
is most powerful, him it thus torments and stirs the most. Alex-
ander, not content to have traversed on foot the deserts of Libya,
to have conquered the Orient to the farthest ocean, to have mas-

He would have tried, I think, last of all to ascend the heavenS.
Some such wish all kings have, even though not all are so bold.

haye been committed to attain and extend power, for brothers do
not restrain their wicked hands from the stain of brothers' blood,

nor sons from the blood of parents, nor parents from the blood of

sons, Indeed, nowhere is man's recklessness apt to run riot further
nor more viciously. And to your astonishment, you see the minds
of old men no less eager in this than the minds of young men,
childless men no less eager than parentS, kings than usurperS.
But if domination is usually sought with such great resolution,
how much greater must be the resolution to preserve it! For it is
by no means so discreditable not to increase an empire as to
impair it, nor is it so shameful not to annex another's kingdom to
your own as for your own to be annexed to another's. And when
