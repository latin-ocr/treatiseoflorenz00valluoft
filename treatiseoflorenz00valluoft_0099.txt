THE DONATION OF CONSTANTINE 87

speaks of the Emperor's satrapS‚ and puts them in before the
Senate, though all honors, even those bestowed upon the ruling
prince, are decreed by the Senate alone, or with the addition “and
the Roman people.'’ Thus we see carved on ancient stones or
bronze tablets or coins two letterS, “S. C.,'' that is “By decree of
the Senate,'' or four, “S. P. Q. R.,'' that is, “The Senate and the
Roman People.'' And according to Tertullian, when Pontius

Caesar before the overthrow of the republic had been a member of
the “popular'' party, Cato of the “optimates'' The difference
between them Sallust explained. But the “optimates'' are not
spoken of as belonging to the [Emperor's] council, any more than
the “popular'' party, or other respectable men are.

But what wonder that the “optimates'' belonged to the council,
when, if we believe this fellow‚ “all the people,'' and the people
“subject to the Roman church'' at that, acted officially with the
Senate and the Caesar!2 And what people are these? The Roman
