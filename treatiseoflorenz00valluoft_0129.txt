THE DONATION OF CONSTANTINE 117

“linteamina’' [linen cloths or sheetS, translated above, linen].
“Mappae'' [serviettes] go with the table, “linteamina'' with the
couch. And as though there were doubt as to their color, he
explainS, “that is to say, of the whitest color.’' Talk worthy of
Constantine; fluency worthy of Lactantius; not only in the other
phrases, but also in that one, “may mount mounts'’l

And when he had said nothing about the garb of senatorS, the
broad stripe, the purple, and the rest, he thought he had to talk
about their shoes; nor does he specify the crescents [which were
on their shoes], but “sockS,'' or rather he *says “with felt sockS,''
and then as usual he explains, “that is, with white linen,’' as
though socks were of linen! I cannot at the moment think where
I have found the word “udones'' [socks], except· in Valerius
Martial, whose distich inscribed “Cilician Socks'’ runs:

“Wool did not produce these, but the beard of an ill-smelling goat.
Would that the sole in the gulf of the Cinyps might lie.''²

So the “socks'' are not linen, nor white, with which this two-legged
ass sayS, not that the feet of senators are clad, but that senators
are distinguished.

And in the phrase “that the terrestrial orders may be adorned
to the glory of God, just as the celestial,” what do you call celes-
tial, what terrestrial? How are the celestial orders adorned?2 You
may—*have seen what glory to God this is. But I, if Ι believe
anything, deem nothing more hateful to God and to the rest of
humanity'than such presumption of clergy in the secular sphere.
But why do Ι attack individual items? Time would fail me if I
should try, Ι do not say to dwell upon, but to touch upon them all.

“Above all things, moreover, we give permission to the blessed

’ Sylvester and his successors, from our edict, that he may make
, priest whomever he wisheS, according to his own pleasure and ’ ‘

counsel, and enroll him in the pious number of the religious clergy

1 Martial, XIV, 141 (140).
2 Valla for this part of his criticism uses the rather unintelligible order of words
found in most texts os the Donation, instead of the more intelligible order which

he used in his earlier quotations. Cf. pp. 102, 103.
