estateS, and you do not explain which landed estates You have
enriched “with different objectS,'' and you do not show when nor
with what objectS. You want the corners of the earth to be ad-
ministered by Sylvester, and you do not explain how they are to

Italy and no one living there calls it western; for we say the
Spains are in the west, and Italy extendS, on one hand to the

the'east. Asia? This alone includes the whole east, but it includes
the north also, like Europe. What do you count as southern?
Africa, 01 6011156. But why do you not speciiy some province?
