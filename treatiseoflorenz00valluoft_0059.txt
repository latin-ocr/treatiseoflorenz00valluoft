 

THE DONATION OF CONSTANTINE 47

the Roman people, for Caesar seized the supreme power by force3 l a f, , ,

Aiigustus was the heir of his wrongdoing and made himself
master by the ruin of the opposing factions; TiberiuS, Gaius,
ClaudiuS, Ν er0, Galba, Otho, Vitellius, Vespasian, and the rest,
in‘the same way or nearly so, made spoil of our liberty; and you
also became ruler by expelling or killing others. I say nothing of
your being born out of wedlock.

“Wherefore, to speak our mind, your Majesty3 if you do not
care to keep the government of Rome, you have sonS, and by the
law of nature, with our permission, aISO, and on our motion, you
may substitute one of them in your place. If not, it is our purpose
to defend the public honor and our personal dignity. For this is
no less an act of violence against the Quirites than was once the

, ,rape of Lucretia, nor will there fail us a Brutus to offer himself

ἱ to this people as a leader against Tarquinius for the recovery of
.’ liberty. We will draw our swords first upon those whom you are
putting over us, and then upon γοα, as we have done against many
emperorS, and for lighter reason5.’'

This would surely have prevailed on Constantine, unless we
deem him made of stone or wood. And if the people would not

have said this, it could be believed that they spoke among them- '

selves and vented their rage in about these wordS. Let me go on a ¹

step-§and say that Constantine wished *to benefit Sylvester, the
one whom he would subject to the hatred and the swords of so
many menx tth‘ he, Sylvester, would scarcely have survived, I
think, a single day. For it seemed that when he and a few others
had been removed all trace of such a cruel outrage and insult
would have been obliterated from the breasts of the Romans.

'IAEt us suppose, however, if possible, that neither prayers, nor
threats, nor any argument availed aught, and that still Con-
stantine persisted and was not willing to yield 'through persua-
sion the‘deSition he had taken. Who would not acknowledge him-
