THE DONATION OF CONSTANTINE 45

“As for your 1111313515, your Majesty, that is for you to see to,
But this ought to concern us no less than you, You are morta13 f

far as in us 1135, it will be, and not the Empire alone but respect
101· 11 35 well. Shall we, forsooth, accept the government 01 111053
whose religion we despise3 511311 we, rulers 01 1113 world, serve
this altogether contemptible being! When the city was captured
by 'the Gauls the aged Romans 'did not suffer their beards to be

stroked by the victorS. Will all these men 01 senatorial, prae-

torian, tribunician, consular and triumphal rank now suffer those
to rule them, upon whom as upon guilty slaves they themselves
have heaped every kind 01 contumely and punishment! ι Will those
men create magistrateS, govern provinces, wage war, pass sen-
tences 01 death upon us? Will the Roman nobility take wages
under them, hope 101· 11011015 and receive rewards at their hands?
What greater, what deeper wound can we receive? Do not think,
your Majesty, that the Roman blood has so degenerated as to
endure this with equanimity and not deem it a thing to be avoided
by 1311 means 01· 10111. By my 131111, 1101 even our women would
suffer it, but they would rather burn themselves with their dear
children and their household godS, 101· Carthaginian women should
not be braver than Roman.

“To be sure, your Majesty, 11 we had chosen you king, you
would have a great measure 01 control over the Roman Empire

indeed, yet not such that you could in the least diminish its ἶ

greatneSS, 101· 111311 we who should have made you king, by that

same token would order you to abdicate your kingdom. How ⁴

much less then could you divide the kingdom, alienate so many
provinces, and deliver even the capital 01 1113 kingdom over to
a man who is a stranger and altogether base. We put a watch-dog
over the sheepfold, but 11 113 tries rather to act like a wolf, we
either drive him out or kill him. Now will you, who have long been
the watch-dog 01 1113 Roman sold and defended it, at the last in
unprecedented manner turn into a wolf?

“But you must know, since you compel us to speak⁹harshly in ι

defense 01 0111· rights, that you have no right over the Empire of)
