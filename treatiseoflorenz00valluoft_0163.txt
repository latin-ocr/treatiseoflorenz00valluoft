this pond was so called for a Curtius who cast himself into it;
another by Piso, that it was named for Mettius the Sabine; the
third by Cornelius, and he adds Luctatius as his associate in the

Marcus Genutius.1

Nor should Ι 110νο 00110001οᾱ 11101 Valerius cannot be altogether

wonders which are told make their way not by the belief 01

sacred and venerable; among our writers wonders more recent
are narrated, wonders 01 which the men of those times did not
