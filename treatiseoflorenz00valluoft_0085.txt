THE DoNATION OF CONSTANTINE 7 3

men were nearly contemporary with Constantine. Add to this also
the testimony of the Roman pontiff who not only took part, but
the leading part in these eventS, who was not merely a witness
but the prime movet, who narrates, not another’s doings, but his
own. 1*{Css‘?ss. to„ Rope MelchiadeS, Sylvester's immediate prede-
cessor. Hesays: “The church reached the point where not only
the-'‘flationS, but even the Roman rulers who held sway over the ’
whole world, came together into the faith of Christ and the sacra-
ments of the saith. One of their number, a most devout man, Con-
stantine, the first openly to come to belief in the Truth, gave
permission to those living under his government, throughout the
*whole world, not only to become ChristianS, but even to build
churcheS, and he decreed that landed estates be distributed among
these. F inally also the said ruler bestowed immense offerings, and
began the building of the temple which was the first seat of the
blessed Peter, going so far as to leave his imperial residence and
give it over for the use of the blessed Peter and his successors.'’1
You see, incidentally, that Melchiades does not say that anything
was given by Constantine except the Lateran palace‚ and landed
estateS, which Gregory mentions very frequen'tly‘in‘ his register.
Where are those who do not permit us to call into question
whether the Donation of Constantine is valid, when the “dona-

alone?

hood, would naturally be construed as implying this, especially when taken in
connection with the chapter headings in use long before Valla’s time; e.g., ix, 9,
ἓξ 1-12. In his Life of Constantine, i, 27-32, however, Eusebius tells the story of
the Emperor's conversion in the campaign against Maxentius in 312 by the heavenly
apparition, thus implying that he was not previously a Christian. Valla does not
seem to have known of this latter work. Nor is he aware of the passage in Jerome,
Chron. ad. ann„ 2353, that Constantine was baptized near the end of his life by
Eusebius of Nicomedia.

1 This is an extract from a spurious letter purporting to be from Melchiades, or
Miltiades; as palpable a forgery as the Donation of Constantine itself. The whole
letter is given in Migne, P. L., viii, column 566.

For the question when Constantine became a Christian, and of his relations
with the Popes and the church, cf. Coleman, Constantine the Great and Chris-
tianity, with references to sources and literature.
