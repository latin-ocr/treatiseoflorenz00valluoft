THE DoNATION OF CONSTANTINE 37

there-in„ Qffiffiotyhany mention made of a “donation''? Not at all.
But of' this, more later,

“w He Wa's cured of leprosy? He took on therefore a Christian
spirit3 he was imbued with the sear of God, with the love of God;

he wished to honor him. N evertheless I cannot be persuaded that
he wished to give away 5ο much3 for, so far as I see, no one,
either pagan, in hB'fiEf'6f the gods οι believer, in honor of the
living God* ffffisigried his empire and given it to priests. In
sooth, of the kings of Israel none could be brought to permit his
people to g0, according to the former custom, to sacrifice at the
temple in Jerusalem; for sear lest, moved by that solemn religious
ceremony and by the majesty of the temple, they should return
to the king of Judah from whom they had revolted. And how
much more is Constantine represented to have done! And that
you may not flatter yourself with the cure of leprosy, [let me
say that] Jeroboam was the first one chosen by God to be king
of Israel and indeed from a very low estate, which to my mind is
more than being healed of leprosy; nevertheless he did not pre-
sume to entrust his kingdom to God. And will you have Constan-
tine give to God a kingdom which he had not received from him,
and that, too, when he would offend his sons (which was not the
case with Jeroboam), humiliate his friendS, ignore his relativeS‚
injure his country, plunge everybody into grief, and forget his
own interests!

But if, having been such a man as he was, he had been trans-
formed as it were into another man, there would certainly not
have been lacking those who would warn him, most of all his
sonS, his relativeS, and his friends, Who does not think that they
