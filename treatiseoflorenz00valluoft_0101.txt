THE DONATION OF CONSTANTINE 89

people? But why not say the Roman people‚ rather than the
“people subject''? What new insult is this to the Quirites of whom
the great poet sings:

“Do thou, Ο Roman, take care to rule the peoples with imperial
swayl''²

Can those who rule other peopleS, themselves be called a subject
people? It is preposterous! For in this, as Gregory in many letters
testifies‚ the Roman ruler differs from the otherS, that he alone is
r'uler of a free people. But be this as it may. Are not other peoples
also subject? Or do you mean others also? How could it be
brought to pass in three days that all the people subject to the
government of the Roman church gave assent to that decree?
Though did every Tom, Dick‚ and Harry give his judgment?
What! would Constantine, before he had subjected the people
to the Roman pontifi, call them subject? How is it that those
who are called subjects⁴ are said to have been in authority in the
making of the decree? How is it that they are said to have decreed
-this very thing, that they should be subject and that he to who-m
they are already subject should have them as his subjects? What
else do you d0, you wretch, other than admit that you have the
wil-l to commit forgery, but not the ability?

“Choosing that same prince of the apostles, or his vicarS, to
be our constant intercessors with God. And, to the extent of our
earthly imperial power, we have decreed that his holy Roman
church shall be honored with veneration: and that more than our
empire and earthly throne, the most sacred seat of the blessed
Peter shall be gloriously exalted; we giving to it power and glory,
and dignity, and vigor and honor imperial.''

Come back to life for a little while, Firmianus Lactantius, stop

‚ this ass who brays so loudly and outrageously. So delighted is he

with the sound of swelling words, that he repeats the same terms

translated, “all the Roman people who are subJect to the glory of our rule‚'’ and
Friedberg’s‚ “all the people subject to the glorious rule of Rome.''
1 Virgil, Aeneid, vi, 852.
