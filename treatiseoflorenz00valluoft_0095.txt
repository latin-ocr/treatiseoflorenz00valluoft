THE DONATION OF CONSTANTIN E 83

of time and the violence of fortune. Yet Constantine signed a
donation of the‘world on paper alone and with ink, though the
very inventor of the fabulous story makes him say that he thought
there would not be lacking those who with unholy greed would
set aside this Donation! Do you have this fear, Constantine, and
do you take no precaution lest those who would snatch Rome
from Sylvester should also steal the charter?

Why does Sylvester do nothing for himself? Does he leave
everything thus to Constantine? Is he so careless and lazy in such
an important matter? Does he not look ahead at all for himself,
for his church, for posterity? See to whom you commit the ad-
ministration of the Roman Empire3 in the midst of such an
important transaction‚ fraught with so much either of gain or of
peril, he goes sound asleepl For let the charter ever be lost, he
will not be able, at least as time goes on, to prove the granting of
the “privilege.”1

ΛΕ page of the privilege'' this crazy man calls it [i.e., the
Donation of Constantine]. And do you (let me controvert him as
though he were present) call the gift of the earth a “privilege'';
do you want it written thus in the document; and do you want
Constantine to use that kind of language? If the title is ridiculouS,
what shall we think the rest of it is?

“The Emperor Constantine the fourth day after his baptism
conferred this privilege on the pontifi of the Roman church, that
in the whole Roman world priests should regard him as their
head, as judges do the king.'' This sentence is part of the History
[Life] of Sylvester,2 and it leaves no doubt where [nor why] the
document gets its title “privilege'' But, in the manner of those
who fabricate lies, he begins with the truth for the purpose „of
winning confidence in his later statementS, which are false, as
Sinon says in Virgil:

harmonized so far as possible with the translation in E. F. Henderson, Select His-
torical Documents of the Middle Ages.
