THE DONATION OF CONSTANTINE 15

in the seat of the Blessed Peter even unto the end of the world,
we ,by this present do give our imperial Lateran palace, then the
diadem, that is, the crown of our head1and at the same time the
tiara and also the shoulder-band,—that is, the strap that usually
surrounds our imperial neck; and also the purple mantle and
scarlet tuniC, and all the imperial raiment3 and also the same rank
as those presiding over the imperial cavalry, conferring also even
the imperial scepterS, and at the same time all the standardS, and
banners, and the different ornamentS, and all the pomp 01 our
imperial eminence‚ and the glory of our power. ξ. &We decree
moreover, as to the most reverend men, the clergy of different
orders who serve that same holy Roman church, that they have

glory of which it seems proper for our most illustrious senate to

also we have proclaimed that they be decorated with the other
imperial dignitieSC] And even as the imperial militia is adorned, so
also we decree that the clergy of the holy Roman church be
adorned. And even as the imperial power is adorned with differ-

fully, we decree this also; that the horses of the clergy of this
same holy Roman church be decorated with saddle-cloths and
11110115, that is, of the whitest color, and that they are to 50 ride.
And even as our senate uses shoes with felt socks, that is, dis-
tinguished by white linen, so the clergy also should use them, so
that, even as the celestial orderS, so also the terrestrial may be
adorned to the glory of God. ξἿ 4. Above all thingS, moreover, we
give permission to that same ‘ffiost holy one our Father Sylvester
and to his successorS‚ from our edict, that he may make priest
whomever he wisheS, according to his own pleasure and counsel,
and enroll him in the number of the religious clergy [i.e., regular,
or monastic, clergy; or, perhaps, the cardinals] , let no one whom-
soever presume to act in a domineering way in this. ξ. 5. We
also therefore decreed this, that he himself and his successors
