 

THE DONATION OF CONSTANTINE 17 5

imitate this procedure he was driven out of the city. I will not
speak of other Popes; they have always held Rome down by
force of armS. Suffice it to say that as often as it* could it has
rebelled; as for instance, six years ag0,1 when it could not obtain
peace from Eugenius, and it was not equal to the enemies which
were besieging it, it besieged the Pope within his house, and would
not permit him to go out before he either made peace with the
enemy or turned over the administration of the city to the citizens
But he preferred to leave the city in disguise, with a single com-
panion in flight, rather than to gratify the citizens in their jus-t
and fair demands, If you give them the choice, who does not know
that they would choose liberty rather than slavery?

We may suspect the same of the other cities, which are kept in
servitude by the supreme pontifi, though they ought rather to be
liberated by him from servitude. It would take too long to enu-
merate how many cities taken from their enemies the Roman
people once set free; it went so far that Titus Flaminius [Fla-
mininus] set free the whole of Greece, which had been under
AntiochuS,² and directed that it enjoy its own laws. But the Pope,
as may be seen, lies in wait assiduously against the liberty of
countries3 and therefore one after another, they daily, as oppor-
tunity affordS, rebel. (Look at Bologna just now.) And if at any
time they have voluntarily accepted papal rule, as may happen
when another danger threatens them from elsewhere, it must not
be supposed that they have accepted it in order to enslave them-
selves, so that they could never withdraw their necks from the
yoke, so that neither themselves nor those born afterwards should
have control of their own affairs; for this would be utterly

iniquitous.

“Of our own will we came to you, supreme pontifi, that you
might govern us; of our own will we now leave you again, that
you may govern us no more. If you have any claim against US, let

this passage as 1439 or 1440. Cf. Mancini, Vita di Lorenzo Valla, p. 163.
