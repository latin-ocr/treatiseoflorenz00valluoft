T-HE DONATION OF CONSTANTINE 133

another, but turn against the author himself. First he sayS, “shall
be subject to eternal danmation,'' then as though more could be
added, he wishes to add something else, and to eternal penalties
he joins penalties in the present life3 and after he frightens us
with God’s condemnation, he frightens us with the hatred of
Peter, as though it were something still greater. Why he should
add Paul, and why Paul alone, I do not know. And with his usual
drowsiness he returns again to eternal penaltieS, as though he had
not said that before. Now if these threats and curses were Con-
stantine'S, I in turn would curse him as a tyrant and destroyer
of my country, and would threaten that Ι, as a Roman, would
take vengeance on him. But who would be afraid of the curse of
an overly avaricious man, and one saying a counterfeit speech
after the manner of actorS, and terrifying people in the role of
Constantine? This is being a hypocrite in the true sense, if we
press the Greek word closely; that is, hiding your own personality
under another's.

“The page‚¹ moreover, of this imperial decree, we, confirming
it with our own hands, did place above the venerable body of the

blessed Peter.''²

Was it paper or parchment, the “page'' on which this was ’

written? Though, in fact, we call one side of a leaf, as they say,
a page; for instance, a pamphlet[?] has ten leaveS, twenty pageS.

But oh! the unheard of and incredible thing [that Constantine
did]l I remember asking some one, when Ι was a youth, who
wrote the book of Job3 and when he answered, “Job himself,''
I rejoined, “How then would he mention his own death ?''!A11d
this can be said of many other bookS, discussion of which is not
appropriate here. For how, indeed, can that be narrated which has

. not yet been done; and how can that which [the speaker] himself

1 “Pagina’' in medieval Latin often meant “document.”

2 In the Liber Pontificalis (ed. Duchesne‚ i, 454) the keys of Ravenna and other
cities included in the so-called Donation of Pippin are said to have been placed in
“the confession of St. Peter” (i.e.‚ before his tomb). This association seems to
have been common in the eighth century.
