THE DONATION OF CONSTANTINE . ¹9¹

x Emperor] to confirm the D9nation which, if genuine, leaves none
of the mmEmpire for the Emperor! It ls a thing which, as I think, not
even children would have done. So it is not strange that the Pope
arrogates to himself the coronation of the Caesar, which ought to

³ If yOU, Ο Pope, on the one hand can deprive the Greek
Emperor of Italy and the western provinceS‚ and on the other you
create a Latin Emperor, why do you resort to “compacts''? Why

Better might the supreme pontlff be called Augustus from

his temporal he diminishes his spiritual power. Thus it is a fact
that the worse the supreme pontifi is, the more he exerts himself
to defend this Donation. Take the case of Boniface VIII, who
deceived Celestine by means of pipes fixed in the wall.² He both

writes concerning the Donation of Constantine, and he despoils
the French king; and, as though he wished to put the Donation
